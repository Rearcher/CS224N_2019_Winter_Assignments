You know what I do is to write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and never one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that turned to you.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed to bleed every week in the wedding bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom room.
He made it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations who were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never get to know.
You could go to Ohio and please bring to that man that you have already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to tell you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got rid of <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it one place, the <unk> and the monitored and <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, as long as necessary, as long as necessary, as much.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was made in the same thing.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the one of it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about this today.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
I brought them around with the water about 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on a year of snow year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of glaciers or they break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to <unk> and they hold down to the end, whereas others can't be <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, largely as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts a <unk> I'm breathing his <unk>
As a iceberg melts in the iceberg, it releases rich water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are just that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's kind of frequent to be able to witness a <unk> iceberg here.
Here they go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, starting to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one <unk> a baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to hang up too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception I don't pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in an case, the chromosome and the sperm is linked to the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the sperm chromosome joins the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my ground I would get two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a training of training, and what I study in this case is the way that people are <unk> the anatomy of human bodies -- to say, how have the body fluid and the idea of the <unk> what do you think about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physics of the physics doesn't fit into the male and conventional female <unk>
In <unk> we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> embraces many ways.
I'm going to give you a few examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't lie in the normal forms of male or female.
For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene from the chromosome and tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that gets <unk>
And then, in life -- the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't influence the body of testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
Is it <unk> <unk>
So, there's high testosterone levels but without reaction.
As a result, the body develops on the course of the course of a <unk>
When I <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a girl. He's raised as a child.
And often, it's not even about puberty, when puberty, and developing your breast but they don't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is going on.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and Y.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called the areolar <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I think of a <unk> woman -- I don't know her structure -- I think it's a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me have the most exposed brain to <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that have <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19 year-old guy who was born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, had been a life as a kid and just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had a extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th chromosomes and in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, she was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> which is, they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> <unk> twins, or <unk> are <unk> to <unk> surgeries is not to be able to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that we went to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy carries <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- <unk> being a black means to have African anatomy in terms of historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very much <unk> ideas in our culture to <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born as two people inside a body.
The highest case of the highest case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the fabric of their sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called a lot of journalists called wonder, "What do you test are going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to reporters that there's no such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we get to science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought these categories -- we thought it was <unk> stable categories that will be driven directly with categories -- <unk> <unk> are a lot more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> ground.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go into science we get more and more in a very awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to do with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved it still without the <unk>
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a hard situation that we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies -- but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
I would argue that these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking about.
It was <unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were as brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find every way to see that musical <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with parents <unk>
<unk> <unk> were to me, the first activists of anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and it was <unk> with another that it was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we did -- what <unk> our dads <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was going to be the political power for the right of your grandfather to the father and then the son, and so on.
The youngest <unk> rejected that idea and replace it for a new <unk> concept and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the field of game and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy that cared about was the anatomy of common and not <unk>
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it stays very clear, if you look at the story of the dads -- that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from <unk> explanations -- and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed through a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women are born.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people from color that we engage with the <unk> coincidence about the <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk>
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking why we keep them in certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> by anatomy.
I don't want to say that the children of five years should be allowed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me they have sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two creatures in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, the other hand, was born the March March 1, 1980.
For the fact that he had been born three months before Mary was attributed all the rights three months before Henry -- the right for sex -- sexual consent -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Now, Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being a man now is <unk> from the Royal <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, they don't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went down so much in the field of anatomy that we have to admit to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science will be <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It looks like what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to draw the line in some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain point has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have a chromosome and that to marry a woman has to have Y.
Now, in practice they don't do tests that are given to people.
But this is also very strange because of the story I told you at the beginning of the <unk> of <unk>
So if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems good enough.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to do this for human rights to people, because I have to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the things that I know can make more intelligent decisions and intelligent people on their sex relationships than 40 people I know.
So how do you put in practice the subject of <unk> content.
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current awareness of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to a <unk> unless you are willing to experience a change of sex, in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
And I'm glad we don't have a context as a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that he had done a couple years ago that I had made to give birth twins <unk> and then they pick them up, and then they <unk> their fame.
But when the phone asked him the reason for the operation was a very glamorous operation -- he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, he has considered the political asylum rather than <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change the way of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how it would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we have given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I have been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in doing the sex difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in are the differences between men and women in the way of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about studying studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have a interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was at graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered <unk> like <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking gender stereotypes -- so there is nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, the more I think about there is some female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more susceptible to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people because of the state, we may have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And perhaps that is what we need to do in the future when we define democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for to attract new residents in the world.
Well, at this moment, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that much more than the building cost of construction.
So we could easily engage the world -- maybe hundreds, from new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just went through the buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments they were already owners and the other half still in order to get it.
They could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we think about is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid <unk> and what building construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, build a apartment building totally new, always and when the standards of that place will be built in the building instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments provide new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later, I learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following elections <unk> <unk> <unk> is offered a platform in which we were carrying reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities in terms of their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those norms that say you can't go and ask all the current residents of apartments.
It makes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like rules to <unk> and usually are the rules that help us move forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed you <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we came together in Miami, a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> and in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which will be <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those rules.
So the president of <unk> was called, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk again the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which I was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
It's just this airport over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is roughly 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader approached the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained the <unk> that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city where you might be able to go in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away north.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries that would help us build and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all be confident that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily have a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow us to create these special developmental regions.
In a country that had just gone through this crisis, the voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
<unk> in the Constitution -- you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed again in another voting and <unk>
Immediately after the voting on the top of 21 to 24 in February, a <unk> in about 30 <unk> it was two places in the world that are more interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that's building in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years ago, getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this anyway, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second town.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the administrators to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allowing his Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new system <unk>
There are urban <unk> <unk> cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave the back of their family to go to get a job, and sometimes they are mothers who have to win the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my fellow <unk> asked me to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public <unk> and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and publish on my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets, and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to know people -- <unk> people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and you buy it in my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I love color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
So going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I'm going to do?" for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings up someone who has all of that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought them seven pairs of interior, and nothing else.
<unk> for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else I would like to use to get here to <unk>
And because I don't know that the woman who walks at TED in inner clothes,   that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is called a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You can almost always see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> it impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get away from the right people, you don't only get rid of you, too.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play <unk> or I remind them to your <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your interior and outside, you can't look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and one is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it again and again when people approached me this week simply by what I was using and we had fantastic conversations.
This is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, I will donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave the back of certain things.
I don't need to be obsessed with these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I am.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So, if you put a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where's your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like -- with a great <unk> in both of them at the same time.
It's not that mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum quantum physicists, we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
You have a intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is that one thing is saying that one thing can be only in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember watching a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and I didn't really do it very well, it's always <unk>
But I bet the play with that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow them to get them to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have the world, except to be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a physical physicist, because they don't play with parking bars and play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- as they can walk through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years points, you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it's not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't follow all to follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't have.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. Is it right at the center.
And then we do a good approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal with a springboard -- and that runs out in a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I started working all the great machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming hole that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up to get out of doing those things, because I don't want them to tell you, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> members of inanimate objects are not just people, it's the light that <unk> and the wind that goes through and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to push all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then we put it down at a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that he moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way he <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which is expanding and <unk>
And by giving you a soft motivation, we were able to make it <unk> and you didn't go at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one <unk> thing -- and we don't think about at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all trillion of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still up and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down and down.
It's only in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all of metal pieces are in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because look at this, the difference on a scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part I'm talking about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put the lights up, and we looked inside the box, we saw that metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator actually are actually quantum objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another work at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that it allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories are being done by 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explained simply on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I had no access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I'm trying to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you a demo and then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've conducted from his launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There is the <unk> gallery.
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and, <unk> we're inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
So we opened up the <unk> and, with one single click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall.
continue to go forward. That <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk>
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here is all the data of <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the technology <unk>
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can do it in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have price.
But if you really want to get <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems to <unk>
I came up and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And so, I talked a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is on hitting a <unk> with a stick with a stick with a stick with a stick with a stick with a stick with <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get further into depth and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll actually see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're going quickly to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite night.
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh is actually created this <unk>
It goes up and the fact that it is <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are many things over here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same way.
You can online to create their own museum, create their own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
It's about "The National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, even one of the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice for the work of art and that is represented in line.
And the great question that makes me today is, "You have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening to everybody.
I've got something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> or a pixel <unk>
We call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from origin, all the children in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of your bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the race of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
At some time ago, if you wanted to win a career from Formula 1, I took a budget and you put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what in engineering -- in engineering, they have become real time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the very interesting control systems are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers to the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to answer differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As I note aside that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms were coming back sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo, <unk>
You know, when I Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end, he took the hammer -- and he threw it out of Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and so what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit of <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they were played by Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity in the web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The timeline.
At the time, early there are people here and doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns in Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the British team and the prime minister of then.
And then all the world's <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things that we use and use.
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how are they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the garbage in their change by the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to label what they were different from different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag would label the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're really complicated things and there's a lot of necessary transportation.
But the other thing that we think we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> doesn't go on, that it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we <unk> a day is still there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something that we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe has a beautiful tradition of the use of the water in public space in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> tubes of <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It creates a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you go down the pixels can be written on them, to show patterns, images, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open for us to happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it very much.
And they would be able to build a commission to design the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors no windows, but when you come up with it it opens for you to happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when it comes down almost all architecture goes away.
This is what it is.
You see people <unk> by what happens in it.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let it happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and <unk> and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of how people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to show that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which moves with other in sync.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen is like this with a normal display in two dimensions.
Or, in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can reach, and you can see from very different ways.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the lights lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best hip-hop dancers on today's New York City star and <unk> <unk> to capture its movement in 3D and use them as input to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> it captures in different <unk>
It's so <unk> <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can make all the movement.
You can go through all the way.
And once we have the pixels can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity, and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people in order to do something and change our environment as an oyster nursery as a <unk> farm as a <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody else a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move out of the digital world of the <unk> of the <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this can we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serve to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new <unk> in London.
You can go out there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I would tell you that, just a few changes in your genes, they could improve it for more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure for ourselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe be out of those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you tell you about.
What would you like to do if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people are going to do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me watch.
<unk> I probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or may be possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference -- but today I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great puzzle of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- he wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology -- it makes sense except for the light of the <unk>
But if they effectively accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Does it mean other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem to be very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> of which comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take on the most bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> are asked by the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully exciting environment for those bacteria.
It's warm and dark, <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that might want to want to have no effort from their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> towards the output.
But for others, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something maybe <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk that I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I fell in love with something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the organisms, and every cell is simply splitting and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two <unk> cells.
But when organisms appear. things start to change.
It goes into the <unk>
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction.
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to argue that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his door <unk>
He opens the door.
In front of him is a magnificent <unk> <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He says, George, says, "I chose the <unk>
And I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to get healthy <unk>
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all agree with the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> it not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily bother longevity.
They don't necessarily blame the biggest or the stronger or the most intelligent and even the most smart.
Evolution favors creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, <unk> fish to the empty, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look back at the stage, I would say that there are lots of possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that by medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation of the necessary isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that there is a evolution of the traditional natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll up slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when the species <unk> distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing possibility of intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen to happen.
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society but it's what you choose in the individual and family level.
Think that if it could be possible to be able to choose not only sex from their <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
Human Genome Project began in 1990 and he sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near about 20,000 and in a week.
Not a lot of us to make the human genome be made by <unk> and being more and more and more and more of all of us.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine <unk> in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something that comes out of the <unk>
That is reality today and the future is getting more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change sperm and <unk> or change the newly <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life to remove the diabetes, to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology that same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases will be going to allow us to also take on <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the <unk> <unk> <unk> especially if you were able to get it to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take a thousand years ago, and we can give it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options on a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, let's choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust, or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound about all: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom required to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds frightening.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight.
And so he looked at it, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had been <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot is <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
And usually that's not the road.
It <unk> the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words else has ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't did, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences I've wanted and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to hear about anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is when I <unk> the George Washington, which was not very much -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I tried to do better in everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave up to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that we were doing in things that didn't care with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then after that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is like your mind clock is going to be <unk> 14 <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want this to be broken up in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I had a sense of, Wow, I will die isn't fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was on a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> as a small kid.
And to me, that was all of the reason for the world.
At that point, I understood how to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was a miracle, if I didn't die that day.
And I was awarded another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
And you who are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be like this -- but imagine, and how do you start?
What are you going to do, they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How could your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best fathers that I had.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important '80s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a complete paralysis of fact.
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation and so obviously the graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to be <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be an important person and you have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they communicate with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I love her with her brother and his father there at the very precise moment, and "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get it back to do his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on your interior can't be <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research, which has a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you draw on that and register the negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of you start with sexual organs, then with bad words, after the Bush and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And a few years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization and so much moving the things from one side to another we'd achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that they could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't do it." This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from the whole corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the back garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and that when they <unk> they would have taken off the walls of the walls and in their place there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the shipping ride of <unk> my son was part of my dog -- and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They are a couple of the cheap sunlight that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some of copper wire wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a camera -- we put it on the <unk> we put it on a LED light, and now there's a device that's free -- and it's built one -- we published the code -- we published the code in the way free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company.
There is no hospital that can be <unk>
Anyone who has paralysis has access to drawing and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning two weeks of programming, intense workplace.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the area of the hospital.
And he came back for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and to get me out there so that I could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device but this is the equivalent of a video <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were from the guy, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the best inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up <unk> the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some time.
Do it do <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did with <unk> technology technology -- I just recognized something to me with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like you have to do. If it's not now, <unk> and if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations usually very difficult and at the same time as dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
In the area of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this fun thing at the beginning, very dangerous in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a great part of my career, I've been interested in in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that <unk> interesting <unk> and hopefully we measure it in a way that you see fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'm going to come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a chance on <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of Twitter on Twitter, volunteered for the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was there was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes to and according to content I could get it in the face, especially if I put it into <unk> you or your company to do it.
But he said that, this is a very good <unk> opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I hadn't been able to get it to certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the world marketing world.
And as I said earlier, I've stood in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be able to get it out for something that was so hard or as dangerous as to enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to do a <unk> of products, the marketing and advertising, and that all of the film is <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, it has a brand, all the time; all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the brand <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it was more for <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the drive of the X brand in the title but we're going to make sure that we have all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you can get a shoe -- and it becomes the most cool shoe you've ever met.
The most cool car you've led in "The largest <unk> <unk> the best <unk> you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people there.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if <unk> is very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Don't <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to meeting the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the time that the movie is going to come up to look at us as a bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> for the film or to me?
JK: Two things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I need to help. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yes. That's the <unk> When you look at people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, and that so many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the materials, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worth of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
No matter there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   this is one of the first images that showed up.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or easily detected or easily detected or easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line probably the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you <unk>  like that weird bear that still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's too risky.
What else is it <unk>
Would you have a <unk> bowl of <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but we want to make it <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father gave me a little lie to me in some lie -- and there he is looking at me, as he used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
It's your story, and it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to get to the Koran and go to the business I'm myself with all my team.
So what I started to find out of all of a sudden -- that I started to give you a little bit -- is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge big, giant and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make movies of Hollywood <unk> tell the reason why their movies are so successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you very cool for this <unk>
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you get <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much man for man to be <unk> solid, <unk> <unk>
That's the <unk>
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a little shot.
<unk> the kind of little movies that we have, we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget to have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, to remind people is the reason why this is interested.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: science.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you very much more time? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who are going to be <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like your <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, many gray colors, many gray and things like that.
It's usually <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or the similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call him <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Some of the <unk> in part <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because they <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk> <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be brand Tom, but I often get rid of the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could enter my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, you surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings that you are.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: So that world? I think your world is the world that we <unk> like your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you do.
All of those things come together, and they start in a place and in my case, and you start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk?
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about <unk> to what is it?
What's the <unk> What phase is <unk>
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to fear what kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> A: Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides but <unk> in your personality of <unk> the <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going to be done in one of their strong dots or in the other rather rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it is the <unk> nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid the fear, those elements, and you actually get back and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to take your identity identity, your brand, your brand, what would be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or you're rather a attribute of <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool as the <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical <unk>
Or are you rather <unk> <unk>
You're aware, sophisticated as <unk>
You're established, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You're reliable stable, familiar, familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they had no control, they would not have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film, how now they use MRI to identify the <unk> centers in the brain so much for commercial marketing as a film.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising in the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting way into the schools of money in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the greatest answer or what I've had more success are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off to their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try to show it directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it gone? They had success?
Well, since the film was released in <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to make momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talk about, they will tell their customers not to be part of it.
I've always believed that if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get people out of that it's pushing it to failure.
I think when you train your employees in loss <unk> they're preparing their entire company for <unk>
I feel like what's going to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, we'll move forward, I think we need to empower fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> risk.
From one <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Now more than never a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to name from the Oxford matrix of TED -- the <unk> Foundation to be applied to my assistance for TED next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their highest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are completely different.
But if we managed to put a cash virus from Windows in a portable computer using a engineer to set up this gray, <unk> then we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a better <unk>
The <unk> enters the gray, hurting the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we were looking at our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they went very strange.
<unk> was <unk> as a lab in the lab that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at the active box in the gray box, if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it's actually working on that place: too.
If not, it doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> we don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant -- or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we could take the goal soon.
And so we've pulled up and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> very professionally by people who obviously had all the inner information.
They were all of the points to attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me say, the load is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning were calls to function in the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we try to engage them with the real world, with potential targets in the world.
We need theories about how we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's probably sitting in Iran, because it's where most of the infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I got to tell you in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile part within the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly be able to do it and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And they got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the <unk> code.
An almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in their hands.
And it wasn't like this.
The results have been coming from after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
Even so, we discovered that both digital <unk> were, of course, only and a goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, really <unk>
There is the gray, <unk> and up you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the values of sensors for example, of the pressure sensors, and the <unk> sensors and provide <unk> code, which still runs during the attack, with false data data.
And believe it or not, these fake entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds in <unk> <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the vast steam turbines is going down, you have to open radio tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can see bad things.
The plant can <unk>
And we don't have the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
We could get more possible than possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better than we're going to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.
<unk> has become public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK. They really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower <unk>
There is one itself, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that will be able to take and give it a <unk> or another one to make users of chairs chairs and get up to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that goes in in the morning, gives you a great force that also increases your speed, and aid, for example, to handle balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on your back a load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> getting even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldiers: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can take you 90 kilos for a piece of data for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put into <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
That is a reality.
So let's go back to the users of chairs chairs on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are <unk> million people who are roughly, and all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with frequently, very young people with the spinal cord to start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is <unk> quickly.
Her only option, many times -- a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been like this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result he couldn't walk for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the board of board, here on the back.
And there are some batteries that give power to the engines in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress with this very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing in the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all movement from <unk>
Soon a long time later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last little bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it cost in <unk> climbing rocks and even building on <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that lets me walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology to sit and talk to you.
It is in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to come, and to all the users of chairs chairs and everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hi, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The Bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives, the most.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we have done too much on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimps are dominated by large, <unk> the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where death is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it has been very hard to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario in a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the <unk>
The trade of hunting and deforestation is making you not fill out a stadium with the Bonobos who stay in the world -- and honestly we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like apes -- <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a child's game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage the <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions -- diversity of different connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, you see the roots that are the roots of the laughter, the dance and the human <unk>
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> ball, and I'm not talking about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male of a <unk>
Look what she is.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case I love him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as well in Bonobos as humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows this video of bringing unusual things to play unusual things -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and <unk> and at the same time is most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> can adopt a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to tell you, this is a <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think that as her, sometimes we played themselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future in which we need to adapt to a more and more difficult world and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's get rid of our ability of the game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and human beings are not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the least appropriate play, you can be the moments that it's the most urgent thing.
So in fact, fellow primates, and we accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a volunteer body.
And in our city, where volunteers are, in a highly qualified staff you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our job was.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that I certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at all night, she was standing outside on the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to fit and save the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I entered a <unk> building to save a live living because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to have the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> fire, and bring it to this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall to the end fire of the hall to the kind of height and less they had finished off the fire and walked into the main room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures in the house where they were to expect, their treasure. got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the house <unk> <unk> by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at the other thing was that someone had had a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as voluntary journalism, I'm a witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room in this room to people who have ever made, or they're by <unk> remarkable levels of success -- I'd like to remind you to remind you -- not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a little bit of <unk> now.
They were food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's lives, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks they built in <unk> with a very simple idea of concrete modules that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the brick bricks came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, or buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks stacked around a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the block of concrete, the transistor allows you to create a much larger and more complex circuits at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are going to the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, and sound and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're linked through magnets right?
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code code.
The green is the stream, the blue is the stream, and pink is the input and the orange is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue one with a green one and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue blue is a green one that makes light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
So we had this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> more quickly or slow down, you just spin this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an advanced collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world <unk> to <unk> bricks to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given <unk> to the children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light work at night, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics start to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took a <unk> to the School of Rhode Island, who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper, and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these engineers, <unk> it became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be the scope of all.
So <unk> has open code.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is to get involved with the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video on one side on a side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I was given the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take them to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like <unk> <unk>
<unk> some members and we put them to work with <unk>
Instead of <unk> the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with <unk> <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
<unk> <unk>
This is a fence in Boston.
So here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is that someone gets clean up when you get caught up the snow because he knows it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for this very <unk> way.
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, it was very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something more sure that citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when they <unk>
And when you do it, you put a name, in this case, put it up.
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component,
It's a modest application.
Maybe it is the smallest of the 21 applications that happened last year.
But does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it stretches in a viral way.
A responsible responsible for <unk> city systems to see this application realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to get <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
So that's why he asks citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we use using it.
And this has spread out of <unk> and natural <unk>
If you know a little government technology you'll know that this doesn't happen yet.
<unk> acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done by normal channels. It would have taken at least two and over two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
There is now a project in the power of California <unk> that even the time has over 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every state of government.
So an app that has program in a couple of days, and it spreads in a viral form is a kind of <unk> shot to the institution of government.
It suggests the government better ways to work, not as in private companies like a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of government that has new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out we're really good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we engage together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
They've not given up with government.
Do you feel a great frustration before that, but they don't have <unk>
And this people know something that we've lost in sight.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that put us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> what we do together because they're not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government.
And because the government in the last instance made it out of -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will change the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you make a <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This phone call.
He entered the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and put it hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a center center.
It has a <unk> web application, called <unk> <unk>
We don't get that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened to come up with this <unk> <unk> in my garbage cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do a <unk>
<unk> dynamics are different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
And the next report, <unk> <unk> I found the Rubik's garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good evening, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to collaboration with distributed volunteer
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get together and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
We connected two people.
And it could have connected with government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps other people, they would get the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entry of the other.
That our input to the government system is a vote.
How many times have you chosen to a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and we need our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what it holds us from, which is where we financed as something that is happening in our against, that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work it will be to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real government works.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens that have written a very detailed report from 325 <unk> pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- this is activism <unk>
And for the ones that we have <unk> to the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think we will get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do with government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the language function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and it knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of our members of our members is 28 years old, so I, <unk> I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> they're all going to talk about.
They can express your views at any time at the same time and they do.
So when they face the problem of government doesn't care much about making their voices.
They're using their hands.
They set the work into the work to program that make them work better to government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> taking away from <unk> <unk> a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only the consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone today, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities in communities and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I will be here at TED watching and hearing these stimuli has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that they say here has impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning to do.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in West Virginia, about <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way it looked like the world.
She was a <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit of it, I would look at it, she was approaching me and give me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and she was approaching me, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I went back again, and if I said yes, I was running in peace.
He had this human quality that makes you always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it was not easy to get your time and your attention.
My cousins was running all over.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was the other side of the room and looked at me.
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at him, and he was like, but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she got up, and he went up in the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out there, and he said, "I will tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I think I didn't do it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just what I want you to do was three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is that you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you're always going to do the right thing -- even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought that and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the South rural town, I have a brother a year older and a sister <unk>
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, "You know, <unk> and you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And I went up with the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, it's not going to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "Well, what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I say it for the power that has the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things that they really don't see it.
We can't get them to do things that you don't think they could do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of your grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for <unk>
My guys died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in a parole.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, it's so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of three black holes between the 18 and 30 years is in prison or a parole.
In the urban <unk> of all of the country, Los Angeles Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people are in prison or a parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's about poverty.
In this country we have a criminal system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is going to affect the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at the work of some of our developments very curious about.
In my state in Alabama, as well as in other states, you fall out of rights because you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be as high as before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Most of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where the children of 13 years will die in prison.
We have in this country in prison for children, no chance of getting out there.
Right now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They bring people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense of sense, they have <unk> to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death penalty is defined by mistake.
Out of every nine people -- <unk> has identified one that is innocent and liberated from the death row.
A rate of error, <unk> an innocent person in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not be allowed to fly airplanes if every nine that <unk> would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my class with students about <unk> history, I talk about slavery to you.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
We don't really know about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are people who come to me, and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the <unk> after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with the segregation and decades of course, racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we had to do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's well disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to get it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> we were going to run a <unk>
Let's take it on this.
How would we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't get it off.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these very difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
It's fascinated by technology. Give creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk>
In my view, it needs to integrate both things.
lately lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means going to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that never get to TED.
And if you think about them is, in some ways, something that is inside of our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
That's how we are. In spite of being so rational, as committed to intellectual <unk>
And with innovation, development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also because of the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also the dark and the difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great leader talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, a willingness to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no disconnect with technology and design, which allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to injustice.
Now I want to imagine that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
So we go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege of being a very young lawyer to meet <unk> <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> I called them to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I was like, "Yes, yes, I do."
So she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks ran to me and said, "Now, <unk> me tell me that this idea of the <unk> <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences in life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population on prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave up all my best speech and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> put me on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way we face those challenges, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst thing we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
And so I think there is a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very <unk> very exhilarating, not we don't judge us for our technology, by our designs, and our economic capacity or rational.
At the end of the way, the character is <unk> not because of the way they treat the rich and powerful and <unk> but because of the way they treat poor people, <unk> prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I get too much force.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys that have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my <unk> and I see my <unk> and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge make someone in what it isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night, he was awake <unk> by God, if the judge can turn you into something that you are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old <unk> a small poor, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> saying, <unk> for my black client for 14 years to be treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there were been some behavioral behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how this country is not ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only <unk> it was sent to the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally said, "Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car, and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
And I finally got out of the car. He walks to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man -- was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you. I said yes.
So I came up and approached me.
And I got rid of the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went into the first room.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we began to argue.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They come from the policemen and the prosecutors come to the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people who were mad because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window, and you would try to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black man, with worry, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would take a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed up because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black stood up there, he looked at me and he looked at me and he said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man who keeps his sight in the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> and justice.
And above all of all, to those of us who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see a clear <unk> desire for the audience, in this community, to help in your face of doing something.
Something that isn't a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's going to be a <unk> this spring in which a effort is going to do a effort to get the funds that they spend today in the policy policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes don't get to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to be <unk> to make the law law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the last three decades.
And part of the explanation, it tells you that it has to do with the largest <unk> rate.
What would you say to what you think is it?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence remained relatively stable.
The vast growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
That's why it comes up this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing about anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you have excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be in the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than survive, the first stop of all of this data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the <unk>
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So for a little bit of <unk> stories looking at the negative.
That old adage from the <unk> "If there are blood <unk> it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us bad news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance over the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, the climate change, the extinction of species -- scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and in the long time, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita adjusted to inflation is <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Furthermore, the cost of food food, from transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> we showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the world's literacy went from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to find out more and higher expectations.
And in fact, we would embrace the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, mobile conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> would never have dreamed of <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is technology and, lately, its exponential growth.
My great friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that you put into information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that has in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer for the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in depression and <unk>
It's the resulting computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law to the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is getting faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite computation, sensors and networks, 3D printing -- the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, the synthetic biology, the fuel and the food, the vaccines, the digital medicine and the <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy play.
Play with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, which is available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service, that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> of the planet, is about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that it's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the World percent of aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like pure metal.
It's linked by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made a aluminum thing that we use it as if it was <unk>
Let's give you this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy supply.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about scarcity, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than produced by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents a <unk> compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have plenty of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed pointed out the Voyager Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after he passed away.
<unk> a <unk> <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not 10 to 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> would like to share with you, gave me permission to take your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small fridge one.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any source <unk> saltwater, contaminated water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola is just that I think I'm going to do an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out, and I have a confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communication in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And having a smart cell phone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of information and communications and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
Now better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> images, images, libraries of music and music, <unk> <unk> and now they are <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe it gets the best thing to get when it comes to your health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we bring these technologies into a mobile device with the talk, and because it has <unk> they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> charge is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus, or DNA that won't be able to call the <unk> and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the one billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just had a brand of <unk> billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll spend two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before we were in global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And I think it's more health because of the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of impressions in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than never before.
What can we give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about the voices never before we <unk>
What if we give them the objectives wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What would these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions that we can't <unk>
Something that I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams guided by their passion with an objective of course, they can do things that were just before they could make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined in, and they started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns recognition is better by folding proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds that we have to become <unk> to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was <unk>
It caught a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they follow <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: change in the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a galaxy in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could do it.
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 centimeter <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it became more than half in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
I went to five inches.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was meant to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite ugly, he called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we ran studies in the South Sea Sea <unk> and, especially in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are tiny blobs on a few <unk> remains that are a coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid bottom of solid coral, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead turtle, here.
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a living one.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to do it, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what we collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they've never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember.
We had the start of starting to start with a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis of it, we have <unk> biodiversity, lots of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they didn't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the kind of changes.
And at the end I keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in great measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer -- or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
One doesn't lose animals.
You lose different animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on large animals, and in a synonymous of big fish.
They get <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of us might have a few <unk> as a captain as I looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or generally not using the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
And there the enormous role that can be able to fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with the marine areas, we actually actually recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't think of because the starting point has been run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine protected area and they can benefit from the vision that they might allow them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the West West for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill up the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we engage with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is to Cameron -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see today why videos are doing viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper notoriety in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be made on the Internet in a <unk>
They get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a small percentage gets viral loads of visits and <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators and <unk> communities and <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this book out outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the peak of the last summer.
<unk> was not saying to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I'm going to put in the <unk>
The creators of trends as Jimmy <unk> present to us with new and interesting things and the <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   You all want to get on the end of week, the weekend   <unk> Friday. <unk> on Friday.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows how often we use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to come from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day on Friday <unk>
Well, it took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a group creators embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader public accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this big inner joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
This is it. That's it.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There were <unk>
Somebody did a version of the old one.
And then it was international <unk>
And all of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a <unk> joke to something that we can all become part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What do you script could have written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video goes up for minute, only the only unexpected and unexpected thing can <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who was protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't get interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> because of the <unk> but often there are obstacles that you prevent you around circular <unk>
KA: Because of the surprise of the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million watching and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all the new that we make in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of line, creative communities of participation, are characteristics of a new type of media -- a new culture, where we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popularity of.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't want permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, it's barely the current media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the single hope of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
You know, you know, the words, for so long, friends, now <unk>
They were <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was to learn that story tried <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the dawn of <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat was blown up to the dressed of the dressed of ship <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the sheep, rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was carrying a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we would first take my sister to take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty way.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I remember the lights on the platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and the journey was too much for it; and the first apple that I did, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> the population is composed of immigrants at night.
Unlike the <unk> <unk> that existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English fragments among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a <unk> assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Even so, I found time to study English and get a title in I.T. <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they set up an extra <unk> in English and math, don't mind what was supposed to be <unk> which was usually <unk> it was always a second hand.
Two <unk> pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform until <unk> because I had to last six years.
And he had <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me <unk>
I was compiling <unk> and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the motions of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until your nightmares started to be able to be <unk>
She opened a computer shop and then studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry and <unk> boys caught between two worlds.
They looked subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the <unk> classical student, relentless with what I think of myself.
On the other, it was <unk> in <unk> lives -- increasingly, <unk> by violence, drug abuse, and isolation.
But many of us were given help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of school, they chose the young Australian Australian year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges don't get out.
So <unk> <unk> <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and activist social activist invited me to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about nothing.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she came up to the ship.
There was never been a choice.
<unk> he said, "What don't you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more I was frankly talking more was to be <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, a lot of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
He had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger -- a new solution to the scene -- and not only is it right, but it's something that being grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave those enough steps out of my happy zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They had not been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a power there, a <unk> <unk> a <unk> mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for whom the slogan cannot be <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he was making a giant sheet of soup that all <unk>
They were going to be successful at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but a few brilliant, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single trip.
My <unk> again.
So three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
First of all, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
My mother grew up alone.
On 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to bring the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
The can't be done proved to be wrong.
He was in the shower in a hotel room in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to hold your hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have <unk> us.
The defeat had <unk>
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, <unk> brave in every wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and see it, you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here today in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
At that time, when you get older, the great Indian warrior Indian, I had <unk> he took a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic to <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me a silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> <unk> was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
So I had the feeling that mobile phones and the <unk> and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
Do we love our inspiration.
And so I told me, I came down to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device capable of connecting the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
<unk> the text with the image, animation and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a character from the book.
In several moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that I have <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always going to happen to me.
So over here, we have to change the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy is going on in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I move towards this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy I have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and drive you over the rest of the book.
In certain dots of the book they are also <unk>
I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect to me is to create Indian content and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> story.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems over the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out on the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, we would take a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of the connection between magic, the Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through an augmented reality, and it can actually see a <unk> group that appears on the inside of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves there.
And you have to make the sound of wind and try to read the rest of the book.
We're going to be going to a world where the forces of nature are linked with technology and magic and technology come to each other.
<unk> power of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University <unk> was <unk> a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you say?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or perhaps not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, we just stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a doorknob and smaller.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I was <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him too. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time that it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than four Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you get up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs we used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
So from next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to be able to go from their homes, to take their blood pressure to their doctor, and share them with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the attention of <unk> attention, <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things that we did want to share it with you with a video.
We all have <unk> controls in <unk>
Maybe we even have in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saving lives right now.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the <unk> public <unk> you see a <unk> please give them <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up in <unk> and other people are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use your cell phone phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not only as a <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but as a <unk>
And we would like to take it into global level.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find out and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> it can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They could be messaging services, for example, to see if the <unk> which is still in its place.
Please forgive me in this and not just improve health care, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion with the drawing of drawing but it was a little different because when I used the camera to the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to the press of the <unk>
<unk> like this: a very strong road in a very <unk>
But it has a twist on it.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time, but with the common target of keeping the <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want you to seem to be captured in some way like photograph.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what's the trick that makes it real?
Are you the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but of what we think it's realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly different objects -- something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But it combined in a way can create something that still seems to happen as though it had a result.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic I think they're those in which we don't even afford the things around us in our everyday life.
But by combining pictures of this is very important <unk> because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> you must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are done with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of the different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that we find it because you don't need to put the ideas in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a passenger pit of stone.
And yes, I even made a red <unk> the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that the pictures can be very beautiful and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
And please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general side.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other ones that we usually see is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk>
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights up.
It was more intensity because writing about paper.
Why would we be able to do technology on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to give you the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you were to imagine, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of shipping technology as fast as <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There are no <unk> in the history of technological growth that every few years will advance orders from magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- looking at these <unk> curves -- we see they're not still forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
Let's get one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve. I know like this until it comes out something completely different, or maybe I'm going to do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world will be, to a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new way you adopt the world?
So what new state is going into the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that is going on.
It's a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different that extrapolate that we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to tell you about how it might be, how could that transition be?
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is getting away and looking at long-term things.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back to a couple of two thousand years ago when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with lots of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way those chemists <unk> we give us a sense of how things came from.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and it is that, at that time, there was a <unk> oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and the drops grew there.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> oil.
But those drops were not alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> it would be a <unk> distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every <unk> it was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time to incorporate chemical <unk> more chemicals -- more chemicals and <unk> more.
Most of it lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, and chemistry, very simple, but things get really interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution that allowed them to register what they were to be able to be <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same kind of writing.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the security people from the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and we'll put it down 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread it in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells were happy another billion years.
But then there was another big step in which things were very interesting in which things were very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to form the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave us to make communities which, in a way, they were together in a way, and a set of <unk>
That way, <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community became more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together, and they decided to write all the recipe in the community in a chain of DNA.
The next stage was interesting to life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities called communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the brain of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make information in community.
It's <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn how to eat some fruit because I knew bad and sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit structures.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures actually accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time we need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take a very complicated thing we turned it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
We now go through periods of similar periods of <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods -- presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape <unk> the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to drive that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we have accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you was taken for a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
And so on, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates your own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that job for <unk> would not be possible without the modern computer advances.
But now design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with the <unk> designers -- we think about a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine, and the machine with that does something that I didn't get done, it gets much further and faster than never before.
In fact, sometimes use methods that we don't even understand right.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program to a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences.
You could run these sequences of <unk> <unk> running all of those programs, and take those of them that we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to show numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are most likely to tell the numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that a few random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But again, I could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that best they did <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we will argue that the best of the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog <unk> to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children are <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little more successful <unk>
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
Go back again.
Some mutations <unk>
And it tries again, and it tries new generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in some complicated cases, in a few minutes.
In the end, we ended up with programs that orders such a perfect way.
In fact, they're much more efficient than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They are very strange hardware.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I have the security that they achieve the goal because they come from a variety of thousands of programs that were doing it.
In fact, their lives actually depend on it.
One time I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> a plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're <unk>
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering that we produce.
We don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it goes to us.
We now use those programs to make a lot faster and so can be able to run these programs much more quickly.
Or it is, <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a time analogous to the <unk> organisms, when they became <unk>
We're the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now it comes to the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've been spending enough time enough to allow me to give up part of my false <unk>
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know about it.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300, a <unk> which is <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to deal with the first base -- it didn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three three attempts to 10.
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that you have 10 <unk> to get it out.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the Women's League player in running over 400 <unk> <unk>
Now I'm going to tell you this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place out of a place out and a wanted has two clogged arteries and your family doctor derived it to a cardiologist whose record are <unk>
But you know what?
She's a pretty much better year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think must be the average of hits from a heart surgeon or <unk> of a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
In fact, very well.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them into the world, and I included, with the <unk> of being perfect.
That never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a graduate student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
Maybe which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses of the <unk> of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnostic -- frequent <unk> and not standard.
And I even knew the <unk> of how to classifying the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if I did everything, then I would know everything, or as possible as possible, close to everything -- because I would get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady to the emergency service where I was doing it.
At that time, I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when emergency room requested to go to a cardiologist to go to that patient ...
and report to the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a sound <unk>
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which would give me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's a hard way to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I read it.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on your heart.
I gave him <unk> pills of water, so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors in it.
I sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't wake up the phone, and I did what I should have done, I was calling my head and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to deliver <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to make constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner self that he said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse that I would ask the lady to <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you're going to your <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
This is what it was to <unk> and the ambulance next to the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, of the stomach, that evening, I had a <unk>
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I would try to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was my car to go home. At that moment I did something that I don't normally do.
I went through the emergency room at home.
And there is another nurse, not the one that <unk> from the lunch lady before, but another one told me three words -- those three words that most emergency doctors <unk>
Other specialists fear them as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are <unk>
He says of the patient who sent her <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance had brought them to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock of severe.
I would barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff -- all of their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for all of the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days of course, it was obvious that never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they were <unk> to what was happening.
And at ninth day, he stopped him to go. Mrs. <unk> <unk> mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks I was going to come up with it, and I experienced it for the first time, shame that exists in our medical culture and I felt lonely, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it to your colleagues.
One makes peace and never more make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk is that makes us feel very wrong with it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would take the things and I made sure that I didn't love me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
<unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And in one day <unk> was opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I'd feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if we were to give up the efforts to be perfect to not make any more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it went back.
Two years later, I was an assistant in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little <unk>
He would eat it and penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door, I was still pointing at his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my shift change -- my head asked me to talk to me in his office.
And he spoke three words: Does it remember you?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
He came back and he had no <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition.
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but the top, you can actually cause the closing of those tracks.
him, fortunately, he didn't die.
You would get antibiotics on it, and you get recovered in a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I came back and went back to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> not <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a <unk> calculation of them.
And we had an X-ray X-ray -- but it turned out a normal one, a colleague who was checking to the patient -- some sensitivity in the bottom corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And I read a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague that I read it.
I checked it, and you see some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, called the surgeon a surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every single case I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't get it and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I would fit now to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you will hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg to believe that I would have a hard time looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones who make mistakes and the ones that don't have to sleep and the ones that don't sleep, the ones that have <unk> results and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that they start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you try to support the medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism -- I've made a personal <unk> medical health <unk> and the medical mistakes to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote to the Toronto, Star Wars to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes are happening every single day, where one of 10 drugs are in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where the infections, infections, infections, are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die in this country, 24,000 Canadian Canadian <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system where knowledge will spread every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in his chest, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with <unk> and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> by contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't give their symptoms always the same way.
So the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we get rid of us, and we eliminate all professionals likely to error, well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their <unk> cases.
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art, it's a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance to <unk> <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, <unk> "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> to go down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human, you know, the human tastes -- they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We prescribe the mistakes of other people who are not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and so they all become <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human. I'm a human <unk>
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to pick up a half a half a half a half a day.
Not a lot, in a research followed for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks for these executives and the time that they were going to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every work included many, many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their election.
You know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How does it work? How do you deal with those decisions?
So today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard mustard -- and we would take over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and some 25 <unk> water -- and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asked by one occasion, why never buy nothing?
This is a shelf on the oil oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> that were coming from trees.
One time I decided to visit a manager and asked her, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out to tell me the buses full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment. This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had different kinds of different classes.
They would put a post to <unk> the entrance to the store.
We put out there <unk> <unk> or 24 flavors and looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had had a quarter of me that when there was only six, about 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
Of the people who stopped when he had <unk> only three percent came to buy <unk>
What stood up when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, that if they were six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably have less good -- it's probably good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices will affect us in a very good decision <unk>
We decided to do not decide, even when this doesn't get <unk>
Now the issue of day, financial savings ...
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for retirement about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money <unk> in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds, the number of funds, there were less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that would be <unk> the rate of participation came to the <unk>
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when you decide to participate, when there is more choice, even in that case, there's a negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of choice, the more people will be inspired by avoiding actions or investment.
In the way there were more options, they were more willing to invest in financial <unk>
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to deliver more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that <unk> the decision -- even when this is against us self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick up things less <unk> even though it seems to them better.
The main reason is that we will be able to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, to contrast and choose from that amazing <unk>
Today I want to show you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so that you can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually, what we're seeing increasingly is that if you choose to cut, get rid of <unk> <unk> options, will be an increase in sales <unk> <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation <unk> the products for <unk> that they are less likely to be gained <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> higher sales and under costs.
And you know that the shelves of today, on average, offer 45 products.
In a tent we are offered about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers just 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato sauce in tin.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle better choices is the <unk> David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the employees from Harvard are <unk> automatically to a life of life.
Those who really wanted to choose, are you 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They know that people often say, "I don't know how <unk>
These are all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience on a holiday with all paid the world's most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause.
<unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first turn, that in the second, but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images were made to be more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the overload of choices that it's <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete, very concrete ways.
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average, when it uses debit cards or debit that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
The meeting that <unk> exactly as a <unk> did a little <unk>
What we added was that we would give the staff to think of the positive things that they were doing in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
What we saw is that in the supermarket. We saw that throughout <unk> <unk> the computer exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
Turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This scheme is totally useless.
The categories must tell something to you who they were going to do, not that the <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge <unk> <unk>
Who is supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can drive a lot more information than we think about if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision -- you buy a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows for <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
I had 56 outside of the car.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order where the decisions are.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> by 56 colors, so many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How about you are.
If you were <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
And we found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button and again, and another more.
<unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of the information presented to us.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
If you choose the box of change doesn't tell anything about the preferences of <unk> interior, in all ways we are being <unk>
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
And I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> to eliminate alternative alternatives -- we can make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to <unk>
And how much more careful we are in our choices best we can practice art <unk>
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s years in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter that I had to get to the government.
You had to register a piece of text text with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
And in the West, we don't think that someone could do this, how much this is <unk> freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, if you buy a laser printer from any laser manufacturer and shape a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow dots on every page that follows a pattern that makes you and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be <unk> a lot for this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the Web.
If we see what's happening in the online world, we can put the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks for a lot of money, a lot of those.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that we would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we bought <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought a computer <unk>
The secret service in the United States, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most of the crimes in this line.
The second group of <unk> in terms that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, the protests, motivate them to motivate them to motivate them to motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a massive role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, <unk> them like Anonymous that do it to protest and the last group are the national and governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack, against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the bottom last fall because of a <unk>
We will take the safety of the site and create a <unk>
And last week I asked, at a meeting with elected government representatives I asked one of the leaders if you were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack of <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we had a foreign authority foreign authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt in Egypt <unk> the headquarters for the British secret police in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a large scale of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool.
The company headquarters is right here.
That is, Western governments provide tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspected in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why would you care?
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that you're going to do, it's going to be forever.
They were blind in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the south of National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like zebras migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we got in the morning and we found it in the morning and they found it very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, we think we came from the sky with our animals and the whole land for <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
People are dying of our community that protect our community and cattle, and they're also annoying with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of their father and this was the same thing that I was going to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were scared of fear.
But I realized that this really doesn't be <unk> because even helped lions see the <unk>
I don't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions to believe that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart --  they came the first day and they came up with the <unk> and they were -- but the second day, they came back, and they said, this thing is not moving.  And so I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with the one that turned out and off the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and battery <unk> electricity to the little <unk> <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> get out there, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> to lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights on.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now through Kenya, to frightening other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants as well.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International International and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was only a child in the meadows in the savanna <unk> cows of my father, and used to see airplanes to fly, and tell me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is listening to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electrical inventions in the other.
What is the next thing in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you invented electric fences but I want to make my own.
CA: So I did, once -- and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I had a few because I got a <unk>  CA: On the foot, Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take you in every step that <unk> friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we will come up all the time studying Kim <unk> story, but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my <unk>
That said, "When I do this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks of history.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
I was very hot.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At a little while, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at the face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
An enormous famine <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over one million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived to eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> <unk> all around me was completely dark on the night except by the lights of the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the African countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North America to cross <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes it looked at bodies floating on the river, floating there.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives to live with.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee refugees.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because the refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> by a horrible destination back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was done, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was <unk> on the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I had my skills in the Chinese language and asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode up.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake report, she's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there were <unk> they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and to find work, everybody can put it in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to put South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Asia.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even I even went through a crisis of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
I had not a country that I could call with pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I started to study a plan. I started studying to college.
Just when I started to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities have a little bit of money that sent my family, and as my family, my family was going to be moved to the force to a location outside of the <unk>
They had to run away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border of North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and walked to the border with North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and approached by a Chinese police officer.
He asked her <unk> and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer approached my family, I stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We made all the way up to the border frontier.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribing the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did all for free to my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance of South Korea.
I was going and came between the office of immigration and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a guy wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I explained to the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM hole, and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and the other two North America and to get them out of prison.
I went to her with all my heart, and I said, "Why am I <unk>
"I am not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the people who are <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the people who are <unk> when I was <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the <unk> the people who are <unk> it needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea.
But their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, the language of English language, jobs and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us continue to contact with family care, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've been a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America a chance of thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Southern Center.
This is Center for <unk> shops and fast food, <unk>
So the city planners got together and they thought, we're going to change the name of the South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles and South America, like this, which is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert -- Los Angeles Center home to the places of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to bring kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
And I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of house you see the effects that the current power system has in their <unk>
I see chairs with <unk> wheels and sold as long cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that doesn't have any pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a forest forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters x
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it up.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we get together and we started to plant our food of food, trees -- <unk> trees -- you know, nine vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of paid <unk> made up by gardeners of all of the city and completely volunteer, and all we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city went on top and <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made it <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court warrant for planting food on a piece of land than nobody else --  -- so I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> and we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called the <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the U.S. with more <unk>
It's got <unk> <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why on earth does it don't look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you grow your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up in there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It will be <unk> to see what the earth can do, if you let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden became an education tool in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They get rid of how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, you get <unk>
I remember once a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night and they were in my backyard, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people will go to steal your <unk>
And what I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you go to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the same time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that they helped me to download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with their mom and their grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a few 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of them in a volunteer.
If kids are growing up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if nothing of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects your mind and your body, eat blind people in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but you have this thing where you're sitting in, I see some color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into a healthy <unk>
I don't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
<unk> about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is putting people to work with the people, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening of farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
<unk> take your <unk> right?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable and have meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road there.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
They can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you're going on on your bike and these cars go -- that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a silent road in a way.
The solution for that is to make asphalt roads <unk>
The asphalt brings a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it through it, so all the rainwater flow over the sides and will have a road because it's easy to drive, and not <unk> water never anymore.
Noise would also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise -- so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this highway is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> you see that on this road rocks on the surface goes out.
First one stone, then several more and more, etc., and <unk> -- well, I won't do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> <unk> as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> is <unk> and if you were <unk> they will be <unk> and <unk> from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use knitting from steel, from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut down the wool of steel in very small bits, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with small pieces of steel in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> flow through these <unk> and rocks will go back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the freeway <unk> in which we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then, of course, this road last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then we know that with our <unk> machine, and we went back and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel fibers, these fibers, using the power of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the road, even you can double the life of the surface of the road, they can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about this too.
We still have the show here. It's quite hot.
You actually have to cool first before I can show you how the repairability is.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News in his little gray radio.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally <unk>
"The Taliban fell away, screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban went away from Afghanistan and made that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to join my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that nobody could suspect to where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that it looks like shopping <unk>
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we were doing our lives -- the teacher, students and our parents.
And once in a while, school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban were going to be <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you are."
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> where his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my mother raised became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate your kids.
For the years of <unk> I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can afford to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do this.
So you don't want to get it out.
I've got 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than school, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud of graduate school in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home for courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just get away from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it out of the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I am in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's so <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the hard desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, as my friend, <unk> for them, despite the time, even in front of an opposition language.
As <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went out of the way from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, it's the phone -- a voice asked him to take her daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I don't harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter, and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, often are the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were to school tell me in <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
We would argue that these changes didn't last long -- after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and a durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forget the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They have spent almost two years since that the revolution was inspired by the surge of massive <unk> and the <unk> revolution as <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call one day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, they were <unk> for freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> courage to face the brutal dictatorship dictatorship,
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 dead, they managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk> <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have loved it, and so many other women, rebuild civil society -- <unk> a transition and fair transition towards democracy and national reconciliation
It was established about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> roughly 300 in <unk>
After a period of <unk> years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops on the development of capabilities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> of the woman and for our right of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than <unk> of selfish policies of jellyfish and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was declared and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the elation of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news about violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day with the news of the murder of the American government and the attack of the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the official officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their predators.
Our society, made up by a revolutionary mindset, become more <unk> and it's been away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The <unk> <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today to get it right now, with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, choose wrong, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't brought the peace, stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination, and they are saving for men as for women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the consensus of consensus more than the choices that we need to do, which is only <unk> and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of female -- more than you need to need the organizational representation, of it.
We need to stop acting as an outrage agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but also to put the mercy of mercy in <unk> instead of <unk> the collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that one Libya, <unk> for the war, desperately needs to achieve the end of reaching peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between women's perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions that the same root <unk> in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> which spans all of the humanity that men and women who all tribes and all the peoples have been <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> growing inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all of existence.
So you say, "My mercy is about all the things."
So you say, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
What they are going to do is we were doing the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a remarkable question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody makes a damn good thing, why she is left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, I'm not a social worker, or an expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to count.
I was 22 years old, I had just been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first work as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I was creating my soul <unk> <unk> my head with a <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, the man who loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a religious <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have a MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo and The Washington <unk>
I'm almost 20 years married to my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all religions, all religions, every gender levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and long length or said in the families, the last place in the families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> for which, the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to sit with a man who touches him, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and <unk> night.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he also had a <unk> of a college of <unk> <unk> and who worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me about that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
He had a few big <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he did, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it all over the beginning of a <unk>
We started coming out and I loved all of me -- I was going to love all of me -- I had been to Harvard, who was a passion in helping girls teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and a woman, like nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the <unk> in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go out of New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, and so I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I was able to quit my job and I would say, and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling on a <unk> <unk> who was going on in a head in a physical grade, financial and psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where I was supposed to be, I had to feel so sure he bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived on a kid.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I never had been lifted my hand, my life was already seriously danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I set up the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were living happily for forever, because I loved him, and he loved him as well.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a lot of <unk> for the wedding and the fact of a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would make any harm.
I spent twice as much as our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> and he was so strong in the head that <unk> a number of times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from the moon of honey was <unk> by traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or two times a week for the next two years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or sustained at some point of their life, and the Center for Disease Control that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why would I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help us to cope with the <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why couldn't I have been <unk> I could have been at any time.
So for me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we have the victims, we know something that you normally have is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence cases happen after the victim has put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marry, and the <unk> of the family justice system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend a time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told you all the world -- I told the police, to my neighbors and family and <unk> unknown, and I'm here today because all of you <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as headlines of <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are they <unk>
For some people who are a way to say "The fault is theirs by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have learned that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and that they will make their lives joyful lives and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor.
I became marrying a man and <unk> and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I won't go back to have never more, ever, is a <unk> gun pointing to my head in someone who says I want.
So in this moment, they are just thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence by simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They were eating the abuse of the light talking about it with their kids, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of the survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
So we would give the early signs of violence to intervene to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this point there is a <unk> tension in the room because I shouldn't be dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought them clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women would be <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but to find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They're very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to make fun of me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed entirely what they thought of myself in six seconds.
And in this picture, I'd never had a <unk> in real life.
I was totally awkward and a photographer, photographer told me that I would take my back and get my hair out of the kid.
Of course, it except surgery or an artificial profit, as I did two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a beautiful and white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in <unk> form.
The first question is, how do you get a role model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, over the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, and youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> also we've associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> I've known to leverage for money.
And I know there are people in the audience who now show <unk> and maybe there are some of the people who are <unk> they <unk> They are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York, I told all and every single role of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they were not <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Does it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I didn't take on that.
But then what I would really tell you about every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list still -- No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> head of <unk> <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have to take your studies, and you have a bargain and some jobs at your backs, no matter what you're going to do, is to say, if you wanted to be president of the United States, but you have to be president of the United States, but you do a Model <unk> <unk> for 10 years, people would look at you weird.
The next question that people always do is if all of the pictures are <unk>
And yes, you pretty much get rid of all the photos, but that's just a small part of what's going on.
This was the first picture I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time.
I know we're entering a personal field, but it was a girl.
This is how it looked like my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here's a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
I'm with my football team and at <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are creations of a group of professionals, which are <unk> and photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is: <unk> for free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to wear money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped into a red light and of course -- of course, <unk> and <unk> I'm sorry, agent to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges by looking at not what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect of who they are.
I live in New York, and the past year, of the teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and Latino <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, for what for them, is not a matter of <unk>
It's about how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
When I looked at this talk, I learned that about 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure turns out to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the bright hair, you will feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing to be able to work with smart creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's only one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask, with a shorter legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs and the brightest hair and the highest <unk> but it's probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of race race and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something that will retain this talk, I hope everyone will feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in the perception of the success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was bigger enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go to the <unk>
There was no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum of careful in lighting light.
In fact, most of them took a random story.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 and five.
He gave the chance that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what's coming now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey and you drive the <unk>
This is when we start to ask the tourists that they were going to get to us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and fortunately, no one has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop time in a week in October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all of the senses.
Because, although we take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives and interacts with everything.
That time in concrete that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion is a whole year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were going walking, when all of a sudden it was stopped in my dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the grocery store that you were <unk> of small <unk>
And he described to me what it felt like five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 photos, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and I didn't get closer to someone and asked him, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most skilled birds group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney laughs <unk> as stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that relate to the Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You are far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Trade where we have 16 species. Of these 16, 11 sides are <unk>
So, why are we <unk> are important, and first of all, provide ecological ecological services, <unk>
They are our <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that is not being produced and causing great losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge <unk>
They've been associated with the ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of license and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between "The <unk> and under Egypt.
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of 10 heads <unk>
In the <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open <unk> In places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural waste system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities use this rat against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical <unk> of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs have a huge bomb bomb in order to <unk> The number of cases, has increased greatly in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up the <unk> Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we need to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so to focus on a partnership problem is not going to serve from anything.
We need to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become active to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we need to focus on these very simple <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed from opinion because he saw them fly without any energy energy in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Each thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
To <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> and Somalia. In projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we did is that we <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to growing food.
So we came up with <unk> seeds in southern Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach local tomatoes growing Italians and <unk> and <unk>
People weren't at all interested in doing that -- so they were giving them to come to work, and sometimes they were going to come to work, and some times, they were not aware that the local in as fertile valley, had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it could be possible that we could do anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> for the time to save the people from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew up <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, one tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe that, we were telling them to the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red in night in the morning -- about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it.  And we said to the <unk> my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought only for us, Italians were <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans, what they did, what they did, and then to see what they were doing, I was quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's look at the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we will give you the <unk> people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have been given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
You just read your book.
<unk> from a African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
And yet, they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "You know, little is <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground, and he said, we can -- you can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided for 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start with anything, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee <unk> we came up with a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for one time, they were <unk> but not in <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So, planning has this point of blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't know their public meetings.
What do we do? We work on one, and we work on face, you have to create a social infrastructure which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the medical doctor of the business, who sets up with you in your house, on the coffee table, and that helps him find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> town of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this condescending garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And I got to you.  So --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start about 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> One of the most successful business publisher of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and a company of <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business state.
So now we are <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to a conversation with you.
You have to give you a question to privacy, you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then they were going to come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What show you here has <unk> this tomorrow?
Local people, and that's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the spirit entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils will not renewable and <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The <unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technology to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a lovely story that was done in a journal magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the <unk> year, they met this group of people, and we were talking about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would be within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in bullshit.  And so, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in the United States in the United States appeared -- <unk> generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. This Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you a <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then you have to give you an absolute <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, the largest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, selling and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the <unk> and looked at the 100 companies in the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of <unk> business in bars on bars in bars and their dedicated halls -- who will do by you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> somebody who's asked you, what needs it?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> I look at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us can help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects emerged from questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes to empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant birds that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
That is always supporting music.  There's a parade in New York City --  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures of the world, but also one with the most abandoned <unk> properties.
I live close to this house and thought how could it turn it into a more pleasant space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected age.
I thought a lot about death and I think.
and it produced me a profound gratitude for the lived time.
It gave the significant stuff of my life today.
But I would try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch the day and forget the really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall from this home house on a giant board and he painted about it sentences for <unk> "Before I die of <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I die I want to be <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit at the line of <unk> <unk>
"Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before I die I want to take you once more."
"Before I die I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
"Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at me, and they were <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving up the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we are growing and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center of the civic center, we did a kit. And now they've been made up in countries around the world, like South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions in our era more important than ever ever, to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short, and <unk> life.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that we become more power.
If you think about death -- our life.
Our space spaces can reflect better than the individuals and as a community and more means and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> has 22 and very <unk>
Not speak, but it makes joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> happens what's going on.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this -- it's never <unk>
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to tell words of the one that I even could even be able to do, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> memory <unk>
However, it's an selective memory.
It doesn't remember whether I stole my <unk> but remember the year when I came out every single songs of my iPod, conversation that we kept when I was four years old, I would sit in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal, it's often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although not consider it within the <unk> that could only mean one thing that they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of the least familiar term with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, by learning and sometimes physical skills.
In every individual it manifests it differently, from there that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that will faster increase in the world, there is no cause <unk>
I don't agree with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When a few months ago, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eat anything that was <unk>
As I grew up, it got more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I would have wanting them to be just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, the communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
The normal thing about the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means that there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside and honestly, the search for normal, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher who gave a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of truth. <unk> of these students with their big minds, their big books and their big books, words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have sense when he fell through the hole in the <unk> and saw the door in a new world.
Just so I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening up that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to environment and health care to each other, and if we don't know that we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as scientists have to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and the engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just to study the <unk> but you study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as they stupid things.
Instead, like Einstein, said everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly your science without compromise with ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies -- they're ways of clothing and <unk> with their content.
And when I present your work, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you been wondering why they call <unk>  What are the <unk> and the bullets are killing and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supporting too much in the area of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only one of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence -- <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then we can provide graphs that will address our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are going to be.
I think these are just some key things that can help others open the door and look at the country of the wonders that's science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, for all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all Oxford English Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor for the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that I search for a public charge without any matter -- platform or <unk> and that, when he wins, you get it through the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
Something to do with words I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words they said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They got her in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end, he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They introduced all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of you just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And they didn't even have the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And there might be <unk>
Everyone got tired of the world because this debate would be taken over three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want a Washington set of power.
They didn't want to call it the King of it if he would give him to her or to my own ideas.
So they wanted to give it the most <unk> <unk> <unk> and more unfortunate title that you have happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. There was no longer before, but it only meant <unk> which was <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- but it was really a insignificant.
And that's why the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to <unk> and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take it serious with a degree as <unk> and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't know.
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk>
President Barack Obama was lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, and I want to warn you, is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story have served the title of <unk>
So he won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, was a uniqueness of then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has about 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives -- because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that it's the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I'd like to <unk>
Now politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually change the fact that you change much more the words than they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to <unk> in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, especially that cacophony of <unk> male and stones <unk> with primitive.
Like others, I take a cheap flashlight of light, and he led to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can hardly distinguish the <unk> branches that hold up the walls of that <unk> hole in the ground.
And I got rid of my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days earlier, that he lost control and dropped countless feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep time of that hole at risk to risk their lives without paying or rewards and often, dying.
And I went home, and I went home, but they may never will, because they're prey in slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO that has dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew there was there in the world, but not to such a degree.
When we finished talking to me very quickly -- I was really pleased to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It made me <unk> my stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans being displaced during all of it is <unk>
150 years ago the cost of a farmer farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about <unk> <unk>
But today, you can see entire families for the entire generation of generations per capita tax <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profits for more than <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to find that they're forced to work without pharmaceuticals under threat and cannot escape.
Today slavery is operating in <unk> the <unk> goods produced by slaves they have value, but those who produce these are disposable them.
slavery exists around the world, and yet it's illegal to all the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the wooden <unk>
This strange <unk> show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees -- <unk> women, in fact, entire families -- entire families -- in fact, entire families -- they were able to put entire bricks in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks on their head, and the lead of <unk> <unk> trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
They went through the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no sign to eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> made it out of it as <unk>
And <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to the touch and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side and he quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And explained to me that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't afford any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't the citizenship of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for her release and trusted and trusted that he <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stones for miles per mile per mile down to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who had charge and children put them into their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that slaves are slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
By hearing the word <unk> often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be difficult to me work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously been <unk>
It led me to a few stairs that would give up to this <unk> basement <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local in prostitution by migration.
They have small, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- are forced to <unk> and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their customers.
From foot in <unk> I remember feeling <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in this <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they were <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no window enough to <unk>
These people have no <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult topic -- it's important to point that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people who, in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 children and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of labor.
And I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families <unk> in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
The black hands of black are the father, the blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid until <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
You still expect them to get out of this house someday and go to another place where you actually pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake -- the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family in a boat, two older siblings -- some younger children, a lot of young kids, makes sense.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This kid is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me -- I was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, it's thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of people are <unk>
Since remember, it has always been forced to work on the lake.
fear of her love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to be the younger slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one of the time.
In the cold night and <unk>
And I will point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which I was taking the <unk> <unk> to victims of slavery.
Kofi ends)
Who will be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their <unk> <unk> and <unk> our car and played out the window.
We asked us to do it by a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would get rid of the car, and he asked the driver to come out very quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
So as we started down, we took away the <unk> that I went through the road and after walking close to an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as you go to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path, I ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up to their back, and while they were looking at gold, <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These regulations are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they were out of the pit they were <unk> in your own sweat.
I remember he looked at her eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy plastic bags that then will be shipped back to another area where they were carrying the stone so you can extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to close to the margin we see work at least some less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died he took him to work with him in mines.
When they died their uncle, they were able to create the debt of the uncle that force to be slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so severe that doctors said I should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Even so, he would have to be liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, the face of an individual's possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on the <unk>
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to contribute to each of them and that we'll do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves about each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They are people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images will wake up a force in who you see, in people like you, and I hope that force will turn a fire and that <unk> light on slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do it in applied mathematical math, and there's a particular problem for whom we are, we are like a management curriculum.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I want to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We would give us the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk> -- that we will see further forward.
But ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill -- and probably some initial <unk> that you can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease -- gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time was a <unk> a ballet ballet dance.
In the last few years it has been progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to be able to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way -- and ultimately, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological <unk> so they don't have the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological test of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials, they never have been done.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a journey to the clinic -- what if patients could do the exam test themselves.
They wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do to you about as not conventional or not conventional -- you see, in a certain sense, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone while it emits sounds like this, and we can imagine how to coordinate all those vocal organs, because we need to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the need for example.
And as the ballet takes a level of extraordinary training.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound of sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom line you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of the strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they're both using existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're very minimal cost, and we all know what happens to happen.
When something happens that <unk> cost on massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties.
I don't need to go to the clinic for routine.
With high <unk> we could get goals.
We could make a massive cost of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we are launching the <unk> <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, you can call under price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.    Tom Rielly: So I said, <unk> taking all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people will be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have to be the disease.
<unk> You see, some people can not afford it, may not be able to do it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data that's going on in different circumstances, and doing it in different ways is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors in search of real markers in the disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of accuracy at this moment?
<unk> Much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on your mobile phone network too, and we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's better.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March before March in 2011, I made <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were terrified in the darkness, in <unk> and <unk> and generally we avoid sunlight.
We make pretty thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin -- the perfect skin -- and we are going to get into the press all the time, but some of us are actually artists with talent with a lot of years, and a real taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
So there was a long time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was <unk> -- was in the place working as part of the answer team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May traveled to <unk>
This is a little fishermen village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave <unk>
The level of water reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles land.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools.
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and photos of photos and cameras and card cards.
Everyone did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places from the villages around us to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the town.
It helped clean up the bathrooms -- big, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> center <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went beyond my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that they had over a hundred years old, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much, but where the water had been <unk> the face of the girl had <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not look like it, and that would be as tragic as he had the <unk> photograph.
Over time, they were lucky for the time more of the time, and it took more <unk> so I went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, July, we got to <unk> a village to north of <unk>
Once on a week we use our scanner in the temporal libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we think about <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
Could it be an hour. I could kind of <unk>
I could get months.
This <unk> had to draw all hand by hand using a guide with the areas that the color and detail had no destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these photos of all of these pictures of water -- saltwater, covered with algae, and even there with oil -- even that all of it is along with the time time I continue to continue <unk> so they were hand on hand was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean dry and he had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more photos to harm them.
As he once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
I had started <unk> it itself was stopped to realize that they will be even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture, and we saw the whole picture.
When I picked up his pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble of a pretty far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would be <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the resident to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and know that everybody was gone.
The day I gave him his photos his child was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could tell you, something that he could remember to look at, something that I could remember from the past that would have been written by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them helped us to clean up over <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the great majority came back to the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all around the world helped us to return to 90 families hundreds of photos of all of us fully <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more than a thousand dollars in teams and materials, most ink for <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a loved one.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would give us but the first thing that we would try to look for.
This was the project, to restore little bits of humanity, from giving back to someone in their connection with the past.
When a picture looks like this, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected things to some of them with something bigger -- using something, using your talent to something that are not going to be thin skin <unk>
To finish me, I'd like to read this electronic email that he sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I had <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the little girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, I and my daughter <unk> hangs from our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet going through an apple on one of one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go one million times faster and see the world not a million or a thousand billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I'm going to introduce you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the computer line, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and you really challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it into a <unk> of a second or a second thing, and you can create a <unk> package of just a millimeter wide as a millimeter across.
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet in it.
If we took that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> it into this bottle, how do you spread that photons into this <unk>
What is the <unk> <unk>
Now, this whole thing --   -- remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to do this research --   -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the thoughts of the top of the bottle, you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we took a common <unk> and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit to see that movie?
<unk> A week?
It would be a very boring film   -- a slow <unk>
And what about to test with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato and wall wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a photo, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a whole range of reality.
But if you look at a more time this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light gets bored with the <unk> they still get <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light goes on its interior and comes back after a number of <unk> in a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this one?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture at the low exhibition, it goes very little light in.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exposure than the shortest exhibition could just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and again with a very daunting <unk> we took these <unk> data and <unk> them to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk> in a very interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a foreign future, would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. You can get into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point it corresponds to a distance.
When you project a laser to record a <unk> picture, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like that, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to look at multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction of us.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what is around the curve of the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected by the open windows.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the interior of the body by using <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually an order for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new mode of visualization <unk> to solve the problems of mammography in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself, he was a scientist, converted science into art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collect is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see them.
To create a new form of computational photography with slow and colored <unk>
And look at those waves -- remember, time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here is some fun thing happening.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are passing away from us.
<unk> should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have liked to see this image.
The order in which the events in the world are sometimes invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, it goes to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to come up with a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that <unk> looking for a change, had a cell phone in our pocket.
Who will have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Most of you have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk to me about my phone, and how changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> pieces of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the <unk> Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every provider of the Internet of all Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, on their phone company or your <unk>
And all of Europe stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see a few thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> don't <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of East Asia.
And I also wondered if this works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at the time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is for me to give me all the information you had about me.
And I asked them once, and I went back to wonder, and I didn't get a concrete answer, it was all of us.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we'll not give you this information.
At the end of the end, he agreed.
It would take the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly of brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 pieces of information.
At the beginning I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a time I realized it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what of data <unk>
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open came City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom and go back and go forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see what I'm going to look at the train to <unk> and how often I call it on the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just me.
But all of us.
First, there's things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talked a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how their people communicates with each other to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who talks with who, who sends an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Berlin might never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because now state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to be <unk>
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you turn home to their friends and your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not very long.
When you go home, you get to the representative of us who just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that take them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Jay <unk> What happens?
It's not enough.
Jay <unk> What happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we have <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins brothers, although they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any people in this room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be a disabled.
We're going to walk.
Christmas Christmas, are in the shopping mall, they drive in circles and search for parking and what do you see?
16 empty places to disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I say, 99 problems, and the P. C. is only one of them.
If there was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> woman, woman, disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood, and my disease had the same first principles.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my first three sisters.
If my first three sisters were going to public school, my parents who went to the school system and <unk> that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the last note to all of us -- the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk at five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another mission that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me to get it to it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and <unk>
Yes. The first day in the infant kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 grade, and they keep all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 thought appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as campaign.
The people who grew up had no problems with my faith.
But it seemed to be <unk> a lot of hunger for the <unk>
And I told them that it had enough fat to live three months without eating -- so you stop the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not coming.
I was going on my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get in <unk>
In the summer weeks I was often about <unk> so my father was able to <unk> so that I was drinking milk in the back, and I was blown away in the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before we were doing yoga it was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up <unk>
And now I can put it in the head.
My parents who did this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through the university discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like <unk> pet in the theater.
I was all <unk>
I did all of the least smart tasks I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass of glass my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "When I end up with a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of <unk> In order to <unk>
Thanks to God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask them why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't make <unk> <unk> you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that he was literally born and they gave it to an actor without cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled players.
When I graduated home, I went home, and my first <unk> tour was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> <unk> <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, it stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> of <unk> didn't give us a <unk> and not white, <unk>
They only get to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
And so I made it <unk>
In my first tour, he took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that led to when he was at the realization that he was at high speed on the highway in New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know they never heard that little nasty rumor that is that women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival of the <unk> <unk> New York City year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and to remind you of directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
We were very much easier to be able to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program, by cable cable to Keith <unk>
I walked as if I was to a graduate dance to a study and sat down to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I grabbed up to the desk from the host to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was like, <unk> <unk> and pasted my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
And the kids are said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me or a little girl and no more.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you work?"
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We really should pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't do any of someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors say I don't know -- but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with media, but I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need a whole society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a film with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> of <unk> a charity organization to give kids marine refugees Palestinians and a very small part of what my parents would <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me acting in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small town.
I don't know her name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
The drought drives small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunity, there's no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year later, nothing.
One day is a man who offered him to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
She meets dynamic group of people, which gives him a break.
She gets a little bit of money so that you buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They present to a young boy.
And then I finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a purpose of life.
One beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That kid from that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were to the <unk> a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that he arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled it out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots at <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity opportunity, well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunity, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to the violence -- will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, the 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if he never had gone?
And if I'd seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders at a business point.
Tell about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas on the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, that because I was a college student, a <unk> <unk> frustrated, was the perfect perfect for <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to get from point A is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely <unk> the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> bicycles to local residents who normally couldn't <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point to grow to hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story different.
What does this story do differently?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the spirit corporate spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so long.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of corporate initiative to create a culture.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years ago, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers to your <unk> <unk> we were sent from the overseas.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and design <unk>
I created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for weddings -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the first public public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where young families -- young people, can go together, and as he says, smell <unk>
And by the way, he doesn't cultivate pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for a NGOs, working for government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk>
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So we inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation and guidance to develop the development and put it out of their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something else to start a business.
It's a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park <unk> this is how it's called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
They gave them the opportunity to escape paralysis of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to help young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace than <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in Northern New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not being on the way that we could pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed had a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- balls of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question kept with me, and you get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how a <unk> or where you do -- the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
So here in New York City, the Department of <unk> clean our garbage, and two tons of waste of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and get that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked out for his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
He needed a little bit more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as mainstream as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong you will be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years, and their bodies were followed by the weight of getting over their tons of garbage all the time.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the <unk> most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and they go through all of you.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of garbage.
When you leave the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get understanding that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first license <unk>
If you don't get rid of waste and effective and effective every day, this starts to take away from their container and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
Because we had controlled for decades and centuries they go back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the engines of the economy are starting to fail when it's in danger of the <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out your relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
And so I mean, just at the speed of what used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't have <unk> and we cleaned up with us our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that will commission from it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to make our own.
It's almost a way of relief.
The flow that maintain us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after the 11th of September 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection on the street, grabbed my little little boy and went downstairs and he was stairs and there was a man doing his journey from paper <unk> as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that I started researching the collection of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we must include and have to account all the costs even the very real human cost of labor.
<unk> waste what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is cleaning up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you -- thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally born of the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us like example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very big stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because the coating <unk> generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because this is a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the year.
And thirdly, what it looks like to do is nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worth of a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, was actually taken by the old market that is this structure to the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of many stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in a lot of a lot of growth in the city, where most of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that they don't communicate in a hundred feet of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the entries from the building.
And this extends out with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space to the open air in the building that are <unk> by its own shape of the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that supports the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons of <unk> <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me to model <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors crystals that use the light from the inside of the building to light the building at night.
So with these ideas it didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it was not what he <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because in order to account there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much, much more economic -- not only because of the material in comparison with the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is almost every day.
So we managed to get a great advantage in the ceiling.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create the urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, that in a set of collect water for the <unk>
They're waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the biggest thing that I have, I needed not only understanding the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention on the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen <unk> wall, connected by straight lines.
When I first went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets on, creating 12 initial blocks in size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors of the doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we would take a scheme to make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then at the low plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local standards that set up a greater density at higher levels and lower density in the lower plant.
And it reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving to the community the hard space of construction.
It's where all of the neighbors, they can go up and <unk> and do activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that grow buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> the relationship between the community and the environment and they have as a target to connect the nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
And I had great amounts of hair, very bright hair and a little <unk> <unk> cute thing for the capitals of the states, very good at <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of capabilities, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed in a time after the <unk> was a little late and I hid in the bathroom <unk>
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher <unk>
And then I did.
I had the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few like this.
All the way --  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes too.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows from <unk> and I put myself a row in a row here, just because it's going to be there, because it <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was telling me the reason why this little girl was so small, was so good for <unk>
And I would argue about jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause one of fruit <unk> in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which we study <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> I would have been the literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
There would be no man.
<unk> the lists of reading the high school, because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and we had <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without contrast, there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the implications of the most of them all.
This year is 100 years of their <unk> "In search of the time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> I mean, my whole thing that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- <unk> right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how long that image.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they are so good together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the Kaaba that are reduced to the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel equivalently we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel wrong.
Being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details are going to be <unk> to <unk> the knife, right?
<unk> make us all <unk> <unk> and that is something that <unk>
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give it pleasure and maybe right now."
And it starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single <unk> that <unk> detects in their lover -- it adds up to his collection of <unk> instruments in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break through it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> <unk> <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like a bright hair <unk> and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram are so successful --  -- <unk> links well language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of fortunate soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of your lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real value value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search of truth, in fact, to be very painful. In fact, what <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> These were the pathways towards the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs us to find, causes us to find, causes us a range of feelings much more profound and vital than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal us ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There's some other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at such <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very young man who was consumed with the idea that his woman would do it.
And Freud says that there was something weird in that man, which was not <unk> in what his wife.
So she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that did his wife, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> or do it accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels really describe really well how <unk> do you look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> lead us to make violent or illegal acts of it.
<unk> drives us to behave in fully <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me that I was eight years old, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
One woman of Michigan of 52 years of age was captured by being created a false account on Facebook from the one that would be sent messages to itself, horrible for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former son, boyfriend, and I have to say that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How huge -- although <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
And this is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who tried to deal with how the implications of our minds, and once we are in the sphere in the realm of experiences, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take a <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes out of <unk> or want what you have to do with your self and <unk> from what you ever get, and it's under the floor <unk> and it's under the <unk> it takes your rings, empty bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, as well as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're very good at social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not secure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius <unk>
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face of rat <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius <unk>
Oh, it sounds like <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once <unk> in <unk> to all of his solution, <unk> goes back to <unk> and he says, "I'm not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to hold your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I find this very emotional scene that is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly, it allows you to admire that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so disappointing.
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get it out of the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction to <unk>
Just fiction -- the jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying thing, Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the Doctor <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest saved of peace in American history.
To reach the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget today.
And Apollo did work for a 400,000 people and asked a 20,000 <unk> businesses, universities and the government agencies.
They died people, including <unk> <unk>
But before the Apollo Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface of which <unk> after <unk> death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why would you care?
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical response is that the president Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the names of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some of them ask, why do you get it?
Why turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why would you scale up the most <unk>
35 years ago, why can you fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the length of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The moon on the Moon happened in a context of a long <unk> list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line line, and the plane, the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> and the smallpox.
The technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the <unk> crew of Apollo 10 miles flew to 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, any human being has gone back to the moon.
Nobody traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the critical <unk> about the power of the technology has been <unk> when we see that the problems that we would solve this technology would be going to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the escape <unk> tube from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So what happened to our ability to solve problems with the <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the two days here at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have been <unk> and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that slow down the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an explanation for Silicon Valley, that <unk> who have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years when we were at August Microsoft, Microsoft, and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists are offered to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment led to the creation of ideas that are inspired by the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were in their high point without worrying about risk risk, they rely on small investment investment than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit of technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and that development is long-term and that development is not yet invested in development of technologies to solve big problems because they don't have a commercial <unk> right away.
No, the reasons why we cannot solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you are."
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic <unk>
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy to compete at price at the price.
Now, technologists, technologists, and economists agree about what political policies and international treaties -- the development of <unk> energy, a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of price of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of America, or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that looked like that, they turn out not to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure on food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there were governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon gave him the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant cancer in treatment, and only in the last 10 years seem to have found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I didn't even have a problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas that are about trust.
They're as common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a big decrease of trust, it's a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I will turn to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions, and that might have increased in others.
I don't know that.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they still have the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway over.
But is this evidence that is enough?
What <unk> opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people seem when they ask some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
You probably want to say, "What does it do what?"
And that would be a very strong answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
What is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to make trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain type of official, and a person -- is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to meet the class, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real confidence in real trust, because they try to embrace the good judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's an stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I will have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who were holding their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, it says, yeah, what that means is that what matters in the first place is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is to make a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I would see your own <unk>
And I'm glad I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still have no <unk>
But that's what we're doing is what we're going to do before you trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of professionals, professional professionals, and so on, that they made us easier to judge trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you will see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that will attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we think that the system of accountability that is destined to ensure the <unk> and the <unk> evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they do the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I must all know the similar examples.
We were doing all of that, for the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we need to be worthy of trust, and we will adapt to people that we are reliable and if we want to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, simple actions -- the <unk> which doesn't make it properly.
Third, the task.
It takes the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit about trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, in the end, is a signature because they give us the <unk> other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because of course, you can't <unk> all the time, all the time.
But you also have to give you <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, all the parts makes people -- the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
And the store where I buy my socks is that I can <unk> it without giving additional explanations.
I carry them up and get the money, or change it by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how another person is worth of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been getting increasingly more and more and more and more and more and more than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to everybody.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
So I started to imagine how to <unk>
I first created this tool that you get into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen would be able to open up his physical body to the pixel up.
Designers can afford their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool <unk> the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the <unk> Science division of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
<unk> a transparent bombsight with camera cameras to detect your fingers and face, you can now raise your hands in the keyboard, get into the interior of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with their hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is below every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
So in these examples, we were going to be able to be in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come up to us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and back things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system is understanding the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make them be physical physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would this be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my Hiroshi Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator, <unk> Post, we created this only physical <unk>
This magnet <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in the space, which means that both the computer can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control movement through a combination of levitation -- <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and get to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and down and forth and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality -- the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool for understanding complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physics physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, the digital information is not only going to show you something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without we have to move out of our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that's our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believe that there was just a accurate path to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter if I would work or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer from it.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learning the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio program.
But no adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew I was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
<unk> books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> tries to Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not <unk> a <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's one thing for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It is so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my habit of reading <unk>
<unk> many perspectives.
For example, at the beginning of this map I found it out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like comparative literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers <unk> a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading work worked for researching, why not do it as well in <unk> life.
So I started reading books.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
To <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> and instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can get a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magical door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to come back to feeling like <unk> never.
Having a dream really is not really compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, that I'm here, happy to live again with purpose and clearly most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a PhD student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a woman named <unk> <unk>
Alex walked into the first session with jeans and a <unk> I threw her on the couch in my office and took off the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My partner, <unk> had a <unk> as a first customer.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought the <unk> it made me easy to move your head while they <unk> the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> said and he said, Alex, and what I looked at her, she was right.
You start to work afterwards, they got kids later, she has children after the death later.
In <unk> as Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to Alex to Alex who talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "It's still not, but maybe you get away with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people sit after what they had, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex were a pause in your development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, this kind of benign maneuver was a real problem and it had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and the future <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody gets to age age without going to go before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take the dream of a <unk> -- I want to see. All right. <unk> <unk>
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be about 35 years.
This means that eight of 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that give you a way to your life to have gone to when you have 30 and <unk>
People in the <unk> don't <unk>
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their own future partner.
We know that the brain ends up their second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and they were <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life and we know that the female fertility comes to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> about your body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday and ordinary life has an impact on the person who gets <unk>
But what we hear often is that there's something called adult development, and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the time of the <unk>
Researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> <unk> names.
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, brilliant smart, interesting ones like you or your children come to my office and say something like this: "I know I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship. I'm not killing the time."
Or they say, "All they say as I start a career before you've got to 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better at the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the '30s, turned the music and all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would go stop, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are people here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but it doesn't get <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of them starting a career, choose a city, choose a city, and have two or three children in a long period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's research that start to show -- which is much more difficult and stressful doing all of one time to <unk>
The middle of middle-aged age is not about buying red sport cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You realize you can't have the son that you want to now, or you can't give you a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was they doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma got to my office because he was, in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said we'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living some very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even harder.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she's getting up to say, "You don't choose your family, but it can choose your friends."
Well, he got his head on his head and he cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and he had gone all the morning <unk> with her many <unk> but then you got to see the empty space that follows after the words <unk> please call <unk> <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a car accident.
Who is going to take care of it if you give me <unk>
At that time, it took a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which is actually <unk>
She needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like I worked with Alex as to just sit while the <unk> of Emma went on.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who are <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> capital of identity.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity makes a capital of identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company they want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration I shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you into the airport, but the academics who come together with friends with minds like you know what you know about, what do you know how they think about how they think, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes out of the outside of their <unk>
The new things come from what they call weak links friends of their friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half not, and the weak links are the way of <unk> this group.
The half of the jobs that I was created is never <unk> then to meet the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job that was not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, she believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> She will soon raise her family, when you have a partner and form your own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person who you live now or you're going to tell you now when everyone on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being as intentional in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family needs to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it to work or kill time with anyone who you give them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a couple of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, with the living one.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special from events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I send a letter to me saying, "Now the space of emergency connections are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are as planes coming out of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> light fits in your trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good talk, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth of spreading all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get out of identity -- use their weak bonds nominate your family.
They don't define how they didn't know what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to show you mathematics in seventh grade students in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied testing and tests.
I give you tasks.
When I work back, I went through grades.
What struck me the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no <unk> I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in seventh grade in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure how to measure it better.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you have success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn from fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> <unk> and in every study, my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> <unk> and we tried to predict what children are far possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, and what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the year of school and <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the results of their <unk> learning.
We partnered with private companies, ask you what these marketers are going to keep their work?
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, emerged a feature as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't the I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is having resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my sense of determination and then waited about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly better than <unk> even when we get them in every single trait that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> <unk> even the safety of the kids who felt children when they were in school.
So it's not only the West Point or in the National <unk> <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for kids at risk of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing we know, how little science knows about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I understand determination in the kids?
What should I do to teach kids a <unk> <unk> <unk>
How do I keep them up for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly determination is not related to or is even related to the security measurements.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk> of <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and is the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to be more likely to be <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have at the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions -- and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to try to start all of new things with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick way to learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand the basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow for 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read traffic signals, menus to understand the basic idea of the web or the newspapers.
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to give a walk.
<unk>
So if the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were yelling at <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the way that's called, but I like to believe it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors on the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
These are building blocks so they think many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are crowd.
If a person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a prisoner's dilemma, such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>   -- to remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember the fire?
Two <unk> together, it gets very hot.
Three hundred together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is walking out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together are <unk>
Three women together, getting care is <unk>
So we've already gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> to their enemies and the beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where you go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the films I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film was a <unk> of his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic wand and get a magic wand
But when you see that movie, so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of a kind of industrial fantasy show.
However, the magician magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took the rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> and a metal kid and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the films that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the <unk> magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician magician do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like the self-fulfilling <unk>
<unk> shoes to defeat the <unk> produced by computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level had been <unk>  And so he slid in the room and he was impressed as a mother left with her <unk> behind, and I didn't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
He would have a sense that Luke get an army to <unk> the government?
This is the <unk> of Oz <unk>
How does it win Dorothy his movie?
I do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow out of it, OK?
Why are there so much <unk> capital force in the movies for our children, and so little about the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence films in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know for the experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper frame that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first leak really expected to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is done, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get your reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, the kids are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend girls how to defend them against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend them from <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being war movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is continuing in classic by classic by classic each of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who bred a child.
So as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the critical criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has done a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that look like?
Well, almost no one of these films is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It has still been roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book -- and in the '80s, I recorded a conversation that I had had with a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be <unk> In the movie, there is more of a female character than having lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the guy who would like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality movie, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success of <unk> a consensus idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> is not the proof of <unk>
And I don't think it was <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to get a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, of the most popular movies how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> It's not wrong.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a bigger number than this one that goes to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what he said to it.
In the United States, one of five women says it has been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I believe that music music or pornography are closely <unk> but when I listen to that statistics -- one of the things that I think is that there's a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is defeat the <unk> with violence, and then collect the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very disturbing statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that that would happen, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we need to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the box is changing radically.
You have read about how new economy is changing the role you care about from home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter which was his favorite Star Star Trek character.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these two?
Maybe it's not only the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to get them to their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I tell my <unk> Go and go and fight only and more stories where their work looked like to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked was to look at sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that it would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're <unk> and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I would get rid of <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally, when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, I had grown up to a almost 1,300 miles of length.
And my assets of sea had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Eastern of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in simple sight, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using <unk> and we process it using bright <unk> the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city called <unk> -- missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Roman Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place stands in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of the ancient art and architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge, it's about about <unk> per mile miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with <unk> eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data from NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting -- this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it show on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for human occupation we look at it.
Five feet down, under a thick layer of skin, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> of <unk> several hundred years ago that date back from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop there.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry floor, these are the stones <unk>
So we have a dense <unk> <unk> that goes back from the Middle East in this place.
We also have evidence of a jewelry shop which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but let's go to the place in a close future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the ancient Empire of the Roman Empire -- it probably was written in <unk> four years ago.
<unk> knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do that ideas really happen in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the <unk> search in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside the door of <unk> home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material you're made.
Now we were going to get a group of <unk> <unk>
They're competing in a race <unk> race and they go in the direction of their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
You have bicycles flying all over the place, wheels that go on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door, that you end up in the side.
And the lobby, the hallway the hall, or what there's the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light. The light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From the chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks speech.
They can feel your blue <unk> by doing your nose.
You can smell <unk> <unk> and you think it's about to get into the mouth.
Put it on a side and they trained their living room.
So in the room, and doing maximum use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on her <unk> <unk> singing <unk> I <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a <unk> <unk> path and from the oven come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of my hands <unk> to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that has done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I was going to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, waiting, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of these different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, look at them just once.
We had the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
He had entire poems in just minutes.
They were <unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one, is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> memories.
I said, "You know, when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who deals with this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some ancient <unk> techniques invented 2,500 years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that <unk> <unk> used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How is it that I hadn't heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the classroom of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, although a little bit of <unk> told me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, no.
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of movie live, on national TV.
That would show you the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see what point our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent a afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, I read a number of treaties on the memory of the memory about over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having disciplined <unk> disciplined and <unk> it wasn't a thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but it also has changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed our own <unk>
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined <unk> <unk> and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's not really so <unk> there's a <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, to be able to have brains in some form form or structural -- different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them in a <unk> MRI machine, <unk> your brains while they were <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that on memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed to <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The tournament in <unk> competitive is moving as a armed race where each year appears with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
In his desk in front of him, there is 36 percent of the movie cards, <unk> which he is about to try to memorize on an hour, using a technique that he invented and that just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the right order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there's a huge amount of ways of remembering things in these <unk> that absolutely all the techniques used by the end, is reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the Tunisian paradox -- he says this: I tell two people who remember the same word. I'm telling you -- you know, there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I return later, and I ask them, I would tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> what would you do?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is a little bit likely to remember the same word that the person who was telling you that your job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity. That's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, really doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
with all the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They spend well when they go home to work.
You probably get some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some time later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this back two years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet named <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired as entertainment, because before it before, if I wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He stood up foot, <unk> his poem from memory, and it was so soon left, the classroom <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed them all killed us, but it shattered the bodies to be <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting in.
So they could not be <unk> <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
He was standing out there, only surviving surviving in the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting every single bit.
I took the relatives of the hand <unk> where their loved ones were in between the rubble.
What you want to pick up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial <unk>
If you tell them, I'm going to tell you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find them very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to tell you who was sitting on the horse <unk> brown in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memories of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy things you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do it to do it -- the same way that I would have done it -- if they had invited him to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're on the door of their house.
And to come up with some kind of absolute ridiculous, crazy image to help you remember the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and you can see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote that you want to count.
And then the fourth thing that they would talk to be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
So it's like <unk> speakers -- <unk> <unk> not word for word, which is going to confuse yourself, typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his memory courthouse.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got down with it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a whole bit of a big piece of <unk> <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event.
And seriously, it's like to see a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets rid of the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put me in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school dropout bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun <unk>
I would never have expected you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just trying to train memory.
What it's actually about doing is to make better and more ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a <unk> of <unk> covered with tape, leaving only two <unk> because the skull is the worst enemy of a person's memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that he had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could be done in a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute power to memorize and <unk> phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just tricks.
Because they're based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be building <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> gift -- but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basics, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, it's not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It makes a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of it is not going to be <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I could not even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our short <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks on our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even afford to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we would have just a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all spent the time on television -- so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, all of me looked at me and every time I would go out and I went back in a towel -- all of me saw.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not <unk> and hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of culture, but of those connections that are emotional and emotional connections that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it because based on a building a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build museums in art.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> stable, in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know are going to work.
So we met with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library of <unk> who ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this thing -- has this thing over, the brick brick -- which they let <unk> what you want, tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the human values.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, ended another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of equipment for the city, a place to come up, read and to share.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly drives new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We were going to make it so much, we get away so much, that we get away from the people.
And all of the black -- this tells us, you think we feel very well, but we are dead in because we have no choice.
We need to go to the other side and get back to those <unk> symbols and <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience <unk> we make the <unk> back forward, one and over and over -- so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, this is 30 years ago -- the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk> scale.
Really very hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a leap and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we converted them into a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk> facts.
The shapes <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the commercial centers, and we moved to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be to <unk> or Italian or Italian age.
It may be a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we see memory of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> we now have new <unk> design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> some ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> academics in general, were completely according to a building.
The New York Times journal <unk> this building <unk>
<unk> tourism increased in a thousand percent when the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms, and <unk> how it's possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
Same thing made the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the new millennium happened with other star.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, it actually started to go through all architecture. The digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we all are photographers of architecture, and the building carries beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast, that architecture moves so fast, and that architecture moves so fast, and that architecture moves so fast, and that architecture moves so fast, and that architecture moves so fast, and that architecture moves so fast, and that architecture moves so fast, and that architecture moves so fast, and that architecture moves so fast, and that architecture moves so fast, and that architecture moves so fast,
It doesn't get a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I knew if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any idea how much they <unk>
That's never going to happen. Because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when the pendulum applies to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it's on both extremes almost in <unk> and it will actually become the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
We can now make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you did from the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was in this building today, first <unk> to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell you that there's no answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> and drawings and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public who doesn't accept something that I haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't stop for architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only <unk> to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical brick historical <unk> in ideas that must be a stadium.
This means that robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways that will produce.
That means that buildings will spread to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage, in Miami Beach, Florida, also it can serve a sports or to <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East <unk> of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community connected around that cause, it's not a client alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion as <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to happen.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
The architects know how to make more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you guys.
Finally, we're not on <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give way to the most <unk> spaces, local libraries and households where we formed our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it makes it very cool about the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that most likes to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
They laugh and <unk> and it gives himself the <unk> big <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of your friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And it made me think, "When did I stop doing this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for in Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be cherished and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, despite his mom telling him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
And the thing that his mom tells you and what his friends, or in the school people say, you don't know who I believe.
So a video of her himself, does it on YouTube, and he asks others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Okay, so far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal <unk> teenager who gets these answers in one of the stages of their life more vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are posting movies like this, in most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure on the line and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Never before we have been so connected, in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected -- it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes to have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no divide between a line and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what is rigged digitally.
What is the greatest thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a day?
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the <unk>
<unk> <unk> follow our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now a routine.
And the trends like, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you that <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people compared to.
But kids are also not immune to this.
It's like the <unk> of the <unk> and the singers who are <unk>
But what's the problem with all of this?
Well, we surely want our children to grow and be healthy individuals and they are good individuals.
But in a culture I'm obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to devote our children to spend more time and design effort on their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capability, their studies and other aspects are starting to be hurt.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as <unk> society and the developing field.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in <unk> <unk> <unk> participating in the classroom because they don't want to call the attention for their physical <unk>
One of five are not attending at all the time at all day when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you look at it well, specifically if you don't think you're sexually thin, you get a note under the average of your fellow people who don't care about how you look.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it gets independently of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be good of course, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're true.
<unk> on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diets than you can take them to a food mess.
They have self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at higher risk of depression.
And we think it's all about all of this for what they make more decisions like alcohol and drugs and drugs, diets -- physical, aesthetics, sexual sexual relationships to early early and no protection and damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're <unk> again, regardless of whether or they have no longer higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day that they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, you don't get too far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms -- the first one is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very shocked when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it.
So we need to make sure that the program that we follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial starting points for anyone who would be willing to provide an education in self-esteem that works.
An education is a fundamental one, but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take progress on the issue, and let's be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
It's challenging the status status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you when it was the last time that I would take a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and for companies, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to value their whole person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people that are really making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the big screen because only you will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they have never been aware of being people who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two car seats, what it would mean for her if it was released from that <unk> voice, which he would say to her for not having long legs -- <unk> <unk> a smaller belly <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were able to do this and we would give your potential to this way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is becoming <unk>
But let's get our kids the truth.
<unk> that the way you see you see is only one part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together like a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, will become safe insurance agents in the morning.
So let's do it.
On November five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
To <unk> initially was the innocent, but it was a prisoner for other juvenile charges on the company of others, they started planning with attacks at about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
So luckily, those plans was <unk> by an FBI informant from the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, was unable to escape it.
Later they would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a <unk> mother <unk> teacher in the first two made all possible by giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to know.
And I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to get to wish for the same things in life.
However, in all human group, there are always a small fraction of people who were <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible media to live as they were all living as them.
A few months before arrest him, he sat down with me and explained that over the last weekends -- and he told me that in the last weekends -- he and a few friends, had been going to run on Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that shot I gave him to the little orange light on the target and for surprise of all, especially me, all of me, the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned into the rest and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As father, such kid.
All of us, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they thought to them so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
These people later would be told by putting a stick with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved over 20 times, that instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone is time to pack and go to another town.
As I was always the new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret -- my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new class of class, silent and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not have developed social skills, so I was <unk> <unk> -- I was not ready for the real world.
I was <unk> <unk> <unk> the people, based on <unk> indicators like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences they put to test my way of thinking, was during the presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National <unk> <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence -- as I was a victim victim, almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had done friendship, was Jewish people.
It took several days to come out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I'd never had a Jewish friend -- and I was quite proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment arose when I got a summer job, in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critical that I had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly the way I wish we wanted to be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that of the closet, but I know what it is to be shot by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All the night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest with my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that keeping in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who's suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred on your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who I hope is to take the violence to be able to hear my story and understand that there is a better path. That even though I was inspired to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the biases.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, because of their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
Because of the victims of terrorism to speak against those different acts as rejection to the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I put up here as a proof that violence is not inherent for any religion or race, that the children don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's a wonderful <unk> movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
He's got memories, like your childhood moments project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a superimposed voice in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in direct life.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know I have a <unk>
I have no certainty that you're aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not conscious of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these films <unk>
Why are we not just <unk> robots that we received to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective one.
<unk> for nature, is subjective stuff.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because during almost all of the 20th century, we will take that vision.
So psychology was studying behavioral behavior, the <unk> neuroscience -- but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic job that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a robot science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to tell you that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain your consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are and what are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's no easy trouble with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is it a <unk> inner movie.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do the <unk> work -- how do they work, how are they going to adapt and <unk> the living organisms, all of them are questions about the target work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about, how we talk about, how do we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all of the behavior is all accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually, still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works. For a long time, I was beating my head against the wall for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for reasons for <unk>
I think we would tell us at this point.
We have a wonderful chain of remarkable explanations -- so we got used to this, the physics explains chemistry, explains biology, it explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need to need some of the ideas that at the early <unk> principle before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Her crazy idea is that there isn't such a hard problem of consciousness.
All of the idea of subjective subjective film includes a kind of illusion of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions, the behaviors of the brain, and it studies all that needs to be explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk>
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Now, physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a core brick -- the space and the mass.
They are fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity, or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
Instead, you think it looks fundamental, and the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- <unk> <unk> laws of Newton. So he applied the basic laws of the <unk> and he applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- and time, mass, you get charge, then it's a question of logic, you have to do the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not the object of science, right?
It opens up the way for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect to consciousness with other core concepts -- space, the time, the <unk> physical processes.
Now, physicists sometimes say that we want to do fundamental laws that we can do it in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws as simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what the laws are.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all, <unk> for all, <unk> every system is aware, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when I think my God, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some sense of feeling <unk> they will give some early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think that <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental as space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more continuous with nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful shape of finding fundamental laws that are <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing.
<unk> <unk> complex as in a human being, consciousness in a human <unk>
<unk> simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and I developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a kind of mathematical integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I'm supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a high degree of consciousness.
In a mouse -- there is a degree of information integration -- as well as significant, as much as important as an important degree.
But when it comes to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is lower, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness from scratch.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the underlying reality.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From the <unk> view, the equations of physics, you can leave as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists are basically described by the flow of consciousness.
In this view, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that view, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to address our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical implications.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything to have <unk> then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think that by thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical and moral terms, is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
So if this is right, they have a pretty serious ethical problem on the ethic of development systems of intelligent computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the <unk> of <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group -- an integrated group, in this moment, we have a collective collective consciousness -- an internal film -- for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of each <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer by the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for it at night in the morning.
But I think we're finally going to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal, one under education.
I went to school, I went to school with my friends, I was scared with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take a prize for a community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a obvious problem.
She has not really gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good notes. After school, I had a low profile on the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement if we took the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching a high school in a <unk> high school in the 11th of 11 minutes in the 11th of 11 studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What do you say?
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk>
When people in chairs chairs talk about <unk> things in school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experience with disabled people as inspiration objects.
And we don't are. And it's not from the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability is not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to do it. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lied to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability, makes you <unk>
It's not something bad and it doesn't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hands drawing with a pen through the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with a carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> people in the benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that individual.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to express that you think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going on before my work had a public profile.
It was like if I was getting away from the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attributed to people with disability for people who have no disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard person.
Some things.
But the things that we analyzed.
They are not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I told the so-called social model of disability, who tells us that we are more disabled because of society where we live because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the box.
They're simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold us this lie that the disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, I don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> are not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other disabled people in all time.
However, I don't know that I'm lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to charge the battery battery on the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is lie because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stretch of stairs has never been a <unk>
Never.    <unk> to a television screen won't make the subtitles for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turning all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered <unk> nothing to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> by getting away from bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the true achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a kid at 11 grade school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that the new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football with <unk>
And what's the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just respond to one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think of really <unk> you think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know -- because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would match your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and know what's running through the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting your ears.
We can know that it feels like a man from 110 pounds to us, trying to do it with all of your being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So I would show you some videos to show you what the Google <unk> under the helmet, give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not the images of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine coming up to the surface but we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> the <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
You want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, being their favorite players and asked me to YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get ourselves to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely you know about.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not a cheap <unk>
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you were <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What is the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> releasing the ball on the bottom of the network? Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to the reality, <unk>
<unk> reality by augmented reality when <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a brief refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> in Baltimore put a <unk> on his field <unk> so that I would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to your group and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
You know, to memorize the strategy.
They just go out into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties <unk> you have a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game in the game.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner of the stadium with a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
You will have information <unk>
This is going to make good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being just to nerds.
It's going to be also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the <unk> field.
They were <unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> a wide receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight will tell you that a defense behind you is going to be <unk> not the <unk> but the <unk> system will tell you.
It was going to be an area of protection.
Another <unk> you will tell you that there's a open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land yet, the receptor sees in their bombsight an area of grass that lights and can change your career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion.
I'm going to make a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
You want to be in the countryside, <unk>
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this one to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it only as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology worth a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> and <unk> notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face -- <unk> as well.
Thank you.
I was recently, after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, the country <unk> the southern end of the county of <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure -- known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer the job of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from their openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that traveling between the two towers will take it to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, maybe the fall from he releases your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body goes off against the water about 120 miles an hour.
It breaks the impact on the bones, some of which are living vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that no, they normally get into the <unk> water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will be realized by death -- death to <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there's 32 inches of steel on the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get out of life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darker moment it's very hard to bring you back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an official looking at his life.
I want to tell you to tell you that we were successful that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We were able to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who were born, but the officers were as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 terror 22 last year to receive a call of a possible subject -- sitting in the <unk> around the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with a official named Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were flown down here two times before New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
It stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind and smart guy in New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, he didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had asked him.
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I would pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved <unk>
What do you find?
Does it mean?
In my experience, we don't only have to talk, but you have to listen to it.
Listening to understand.
They didn't have <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels because they probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
They go to the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs at <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social <unk> and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read to you his letter.
She lost his son the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home and talk to your friends talking to your friends to tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but by noticing more moments of realizing I really realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the <unk> police and <unk> as the night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the afternoon before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who has not been prior to <unk> a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers is with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go through the road that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I replied to a radio call for a possible subject <unk> on the sidewalk near the northern tower.
I took my bike. I looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and a half earlier, I heard this as Kevin talked about depression and despair.
Kevin decided to see that day back to that lane and give it to life another opportunity.
When Kevin raised the <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did that <unk> and gave him the hope and life <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
We were going to get to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, like the <unk>
We thank God for you.
I don't get debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> <unk> when I visited the General in San Francisco in San Francisco that night, you <unk> as the patient.
I know I know I know I had to <unk>
And Kevin is a <unk> father and a member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found myself in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
And usually this is achieved by three things: sleep or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Out of those incidents that I've been directly on, I've lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
So for that time, I was sending your hand at three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
They were absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one you leave on the second that they realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us must work to do.
suicide can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your interior you know what you are, and one question: How do you tell you?"
I must be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I was finally achieved with the dream that I had ever had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inside.
For complicated reasons, that I'm going to go later, when I look at this photo, I think, you managed to do it -- <unk> <unk>
But the October, October, I found that <unk> I'm beginning to do.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the courage to get rid of the limitations to get rid of the skin of the skin or for the belief that surround us.
They are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
They recorded me as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt in my head.
And my mom was, "Why always you have that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I'm never going to help me share my story, not because it thought to be a bad thing, but why the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have a mama, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something got me: This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a beautiful <unk> competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> he won in <unk> and he won a third finalist in the top of 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was from queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when they were <unk> to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that passed my head on the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most rural surgeries we do sophisticated and secure.
At that time, in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before changed the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the <unk> of <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who had lived he lived his truth, but he had a end of his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of November ages we make a global <unk> for <unk> <unk>
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who were going to come up with and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> for one day there is no longer any more <unk> of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> thank you first, thank all of my <unk>
My network of support, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young young women who have <unk> and some times, when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it, I was calling my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked out -- it's not. It's just identity identity -- that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned to all of us a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table the subject that sometimes that <unk> not block, and that should have a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies who are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known to her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, the National National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his dad.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at the history of humankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not lunch, nor for his father, or his mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was getting a lot to have a girl.
When he gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, and he gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of one child, when he <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only mother suffering, but the daughter <unk> <unk> when it grows, it suffers from too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and a school member of his brothers.
Until the age of 12 years in a way, has a good life.
Can you be <unk>
He can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, I was 13 years old, it is banning him to come out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the name of her father and his siblings and his siblings and his family, and if you were <unk> the code of that assumption honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a more standard of <unk> societies that's called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl who has to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and they accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and the decision decisions even if they don't want to.
If you compare it to a man who doesn't like it or if the <unk> with a old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> <unk>
If the <unk> too young, it has to follow it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> his daughter and the same lesson to his children.
And this vicious circle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was thinking, I thought of her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I got rid of all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
You might be wondering, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and his name.
<unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of tourist <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I was going to sit with me when my friends would come to me.
They encouraged him to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to deal with their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've been doing all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
I taught my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson.
I taught students to forget the lesson from the so-called <unk>
They were <unk> brothers and sisters and sisters, for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation in all of the political and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls -- and the singers that were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10, I was lifted up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog blog was offered her same for the New York Times, and I talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It's <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and nine of October 2012, were shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would give you the ear to my wife and "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't get <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, because of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get paid.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and he had severe headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm good with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any <unk> girl in 16 years.
<unk> when he didn't end his job.
They fight his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about the <unk> of my <unk> that has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google speakers, but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you join a brain <unk>
You are still just as smart or not?
It's not going to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, gray, but it was the dead part of the middle of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, of more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> them to keep alive.
More than once I have saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to try to get the <unk> dose -- because it really doesn't exist a clear map that tells you in <unk>
I began to test with <unk> and I was amazed by seeing how small changes in the dose of <unk> dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly controversial case for a few months, I tried to write up and chemical chemicals for a man in history, and I was amazed at looking at how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I was thinking all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several different types of people, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as a extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> fixing a problem that he had on the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't afford it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to be <unk> since then I've been better with men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was regain my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I think almost always in images, and that became my key point of key <unk> how to make those kind of mental images that I use to use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind. It works for me is simple: for the most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> -- really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty in order to do this is just to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two recent groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, an image of functional MRI, to represent the brain -- you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain that looks at an image.
The column of the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual while you were trying to see that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the left column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, and always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the National Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields that are <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were taking their brains to create a great range of reactions in the brain to the footage of video.
And then I showed you a film with new, new people, new animals, and as long as we get a new <unk>
And the computer, using just the brain information <unk> to show what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're good about doing this.
We just need to make the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same image, it creates the same <unk>
This led to the <unk> brain systems available today, and its resolution increased as a thousand times over the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't give that one.
A lot of people are proposing new projection techniques to images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets <unk> only offer small improvements in resolution doesn't increase by thousands of how we need.
I propose this idea, instead of a bigger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make magnets big, right?
But the majority of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions in coding and <unk> in the Netizens and <unk> frequency radio frequency radio systems.
At the same time of a magnetic field, they would be using magnetic patterns and structured magnetic patterns on the frequencies of the radio radius.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing patterns of radio radio processing -- we can increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the hormones and <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity -- this is sleep.
We're going to be able to put our ideas directly into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> using a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have a few more options than opening up this door.
Anyway, you choose one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about leaving the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay self.
I think we all have <unk>
Their closet probably might be telling someone for the first time that the love is pregnant, or telling someone who is pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any difficult conversation that you're going through in life.
All I think is a hard conversation and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and come out of that closet something universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of the <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be below that by the <unk> of my little <unk> and I had <unk> my head on a little bit, I would ask for a little bit of a child -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would look like an awkward silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father, <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold eyes to his son.
But I would not say anything, and it <unk>
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
So that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time was <unk> and I was about to go through the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> Gloria <unk>
Even a glimpse of the "Vagina Monologues" I <unk>
And then I took my eyes down and I went down and I went down and my backs and my backs was a little pink dress with a pink dress -- looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And then I took it over again, again, I stood up close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw my clothes, and I saw a girl, but I am a girl, and you know, like you like to use pink dress -- and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more from the kind of girl in a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite ear is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. They just "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the darkness, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how a feels like it feels like a closet.
It's like my closet I'm not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons why I get out of my closet was more difficult to get out of your self, but this is the <unk> The hard is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have declared <unk> and <unk> is more difficult to say it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult to tell your five-year-old son that you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult for us to rank what hard for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made -- a closet not a place to live in.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a horse and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't a militant lesbian ready to fight any child in four years that I would get to the coffee.
I was frozen because of the fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my Taliban and the moving only one muscle is the closest I ever made.
My family, my friends, full strangers with whom I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world turned around to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed by so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable Taliban was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of those guests knew that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> lady in honor, in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents were my parents, people who were known to be known to me.
And after talking to a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in St. Petersburg.
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what's your favorite TV show.
Our infectious <unk> Will <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> -- but hopefully I'm hoping to show his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you get.
It's like the hard conversations remain my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves going out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be true.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must be able to know we also do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex ones.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can get out safe, <unk> for what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours does.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet closet <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very kids, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> What is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of the pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, <unk> a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's take a step back.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an <unk> race that you don't know anything about the biology of Earth or the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredibly incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as a <unk> we know that we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept about the Earth -- that it doesn't have any idea about how to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time at the time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be recorded for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we prescribe the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of the robots to maximize the future freedom of action with complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked -- for a number of years now, there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a <unk> and with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, to an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
<unk> is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain our choices.
And so, having in account this equation, is natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should be more favorable to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in the long term in any system that can be in it.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple animal intelligence testing, and they can even earn any money, and even making money <unk> actions, all of that without being told to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a human foot <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided that they can balance the <unk>
This ability to balance have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing away from the opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully play a <unk> game against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends will be constantly constantly <unk> and it keeps the net right now.
This same capacity of <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to extend the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense itself, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiation negotiation negotiation that will successfully be active under their exponential management.
This ability to risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of smart human behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all coming from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term term -- the <unk> work was always the concept that if they were smart machines, there would be a rebellion of it.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades -- we've had all the concept of rebellion -- <unk> the other way.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all right, that the urge to take the control of all future future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that the general intelligence can actually actually arise out of taking the control, instead of being backwards.
Another important implication is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals to come out of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial pigeons or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the tip of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even over the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity of the stars when the planets go through them, and they block a little bit of that light that gets us.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of the planets as far as the distance there is between them and their mother.
So together, this helps us to understand if these planets are small and <unk> as the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their own.
At the same time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this climate.
The year 2014 was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from a few years ago are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These are environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a science of the weather, not <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like Earth, more and enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites one comparison between the planet just discovered and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated that by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track its surface in search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
private companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still due to <unk> places in comparison to Mars.
Even in the coldest and most high places on Earth is cool and full of oxygen that we have to spread through our tropical forests at thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will take a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief in some that Mars will expect for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable Earth.
For a lot that I like this <unk> exploration, I disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there for humanity -- it's like imagine that the captain of Titanic will tell us that the captain of Titanic will be later in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and land preservation are not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They just find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces, in hostile areas of the ground, we can perhaps meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment, <unk> <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked -- to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to think about living between living between the stars, they lose the notion of what's important to protect the origin of the planets that we have <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization <unk> we will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to deal with the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I went back my own home.
And while I was on the front porch. I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table, where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all right.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had early early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I stood on my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but surely they don't more expensive than a <unk> at a half night, so I thought, well, despite the circumstances, I was struggling with it.
I'm a profession a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rhythm, <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> thinking.
And when I came to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in his place, which was going to be bad things happening.
Or at least if you happen to be bad things -- the probability of the probability that it's a total catastrophe of catastrophe to be.
So I started to think about that, but just a month later my thoughts didn't know.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little bit embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and I wanted to have forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, then you try to figure out what can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not that evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
And in the house, you get a place for things that are lost very easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a location of the important things, where the same is okay, where the fish are, which places in the trees -- where the tribes are in their friends and female tribes and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, <unk> the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find his nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car, <unk> and <unk>
So in the house, a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular whistle.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and are <unk> with it all your things will always be there when they <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take your cell phone a picture of your credit cards cards from driving, you know, <unk>
If you're lost or <unk> this can be easier for <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases your <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved thing, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of them making medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making of social decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take out of that would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab, and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce a <unk> a <unk>
And you probably have heard about the <unk> and it knows that it's one of the most successful drugs in the world today, even more likely you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> the <unk>
But there's a question that you should do so, a statistic that you must ask for the most physicians of doctors don't want to talk, and companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to submit to a surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not about the doctor, and if it's somebody's guilt like me.
We have not understood very well.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which you think it is?
How many people have to take it to it before it could help somebody help one person?
300.
This is the research of <unk> researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I myself explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, or the other <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the effects of <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> pain and <unk> pain, but now they think, "The Five percent is not very likely to happen to me, even if you take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that low stress is not thinking clearly.
So think about how we do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 are side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug that will help you help you.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with his doctor.
The medical ethics is part of the principle of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take your risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to try is quite typical.
To the surgery that is done in the older men in the 1950s, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number necessary to deal with is <unk>
That's what it is, 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, produce on 50 percent of patients.
Those include powerless or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only take a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before the questions that you can argue that we will take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a <unk> life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change the heat of the <unk> but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that point is that it turns out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> <unk> with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, not just quite quickly. They could be lunch lunch -- so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the logical logical thinking, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to take them to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail before then.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> to be able to put systems in the place that will help to minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I went to the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, I installed a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the gate in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the copyright system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and at the time step of time, it mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we are today known as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true to nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, actually are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, it's as if I lived in a foreign country, following blind their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk> <unk>
So how do I understand the sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little <unk> and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"I don't know the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise from eating the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you don't get <unk> <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
They were going to go on.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In the <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, do it with my thumb that it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to be more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through your ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my own practice.
And all I had taught me about sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> a social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could <unk>
I chose to <unk>
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if it had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, at asking for <unk> your voice, I'm able to maintain a temporary way of value as well as you take a loan with a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue this practice, I feel that I would be able to do it in <unk> and not having any kind of social value.
So with the sound as my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was amazed by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be able to capture and to express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as much as the signs of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you get better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> <unk> in many different <unk> different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for each finger while it touches the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so, while the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if you were <unk> just a key at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If just a key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when I use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal will be <unk>
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and get it over, again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all day."
If you get it, and it <unk> the visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said about <unk> the <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present one gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, we will go forward again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> right now.
Look at <unk> right right -- <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to teach you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands in high hands.
Now we're going to do it so much on my head as well as your chest -- something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, a third. Please take me back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
And look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest. But they do very different meanings, meanings, too.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And perhaps people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to ask you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can do it all, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean up each other.
The country, now I'm adult and I teach citizenship and invention in the <unk> of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach filled with lots of garbage.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect these plastic pieces in order to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's very expensive to be able to use those huge boats too.
So along with my students, six to 15 years, we dream about inventing a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work <unk> so that the kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools are so cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of his <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to engage them in something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids get a lot with robots.
And then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in the creation of prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we transform lamps and web cameras, and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly over the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image of the picture of the robot.
We see plastic pieces, floating through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measuring the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the number of plastic in the water.
I took this step to step on a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else will do it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to make it immediately.
I can investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and they were <unk> with this image.
A child, perhaps less than 10 years -- maybe a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water that we <unk> the water where they live, the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil are also brown color and when it's <unk> it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> which can do through all kinds of substances that produce <unk> <unk> which can help to identify what there is in the water.
We were using this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help us get remote to other children.
I was forced to look at a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away -- maybe address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> in the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power of water.
And today, according to the average reports of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast and most of the most part, has a safe thing, it's blue.
Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year since the accident and research <unk> with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't know it.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> you see the use of different masks here.
It could seem like they didn't get serious work, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Together with them we discussed the data, we discussed that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we could notice that the radioactive dust is going to be <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this set up an civil expedition -- the closest to nuclear central to date.
We reach up to a mile of nuclear destruction, and with the fishermen of fishermen in the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> of sediment we invented and build.
Here's a <unk> we've gone from a local problem with a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the harm that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a very small bit of so much, we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we converted it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry -- a little bit of biology, of optical species, basically you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or, we can help in the mobility of the age of advanced age transforming their standard wheels in new vehicles in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave to our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, <unk> creators, we must make the next generation for the environment for the environment and people, and to really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other of a single silk.
One of them is synthetic stuff.
One is a <unk> the environment, the other I guess.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The <unk> was a single tool of Michelangelo.
But living things aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, take all of the information out there for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and production and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world that is made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as a <unk> of different parts, with different functions.
But you don't find out of <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with light-activated light-activated pore.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts mostly like <unk> the other mainly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that takes gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect to work between the <unk> and the gene, between the <unk> and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere.
My work, at the most simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and approaching the growth.
Do you probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live at a very special time in history, a weird moment, where the four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and my students' hands.
We design objects, products, structures and structures and tools through a very far scale of scale, like this robotic arm with an scope of 24 meters of diameter with a <unk> basis that someday not very far to print <unk> and graphics <unk> made out of genetically <unk> that glow in the dark.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where each extent is the only size of the light and the heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a fashion collection of Paris with <unk> they go <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the hot <unk> around the waist.
<unk> with 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and 3D <unk> with the cells and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combined <unk> materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and <unk> instruments that allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the same time, comfortable and it absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator, went back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the dots of pressure in the human body.
His surface, like nature, varies its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> the material ownership of it.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them got me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between the trunk, which would be the leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land grew trees to grow trees and <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world of parts.
I often wondered, "What would the design would be if objects were made of a single piece of piece?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material that we were able to put the material out of the tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons of being produced by organisms as shrimp, or <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can <unk> their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk>  we asked a whole bunch of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and produced <unk> of <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that built a system with multiple <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material properties on the march and create these structures made from one three new material meters long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are lists, they put it down to find a natural shape in the contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were just a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared in the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture rapidly from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of beams to mesh, and if it broadens even more, windows.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of <unk> of shrimp in a architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best estimate for objects designed for <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, will help rise a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the ability to create clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we made our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals -- new biological measures inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria in the human intestine in the body.
One becomes sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never get <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that relates to the <unk> tract that will help you solve these bacteria and to create their way.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> they were more transparent channels.
This <unk> digestive system, when it stretches from one end to another, it takes 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our very <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in my clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> He said, "We are early <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design would give us the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, the <unk> tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of editing the biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer does it <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they were <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first gets turned into the environment, create a tension, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in one material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside of a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture in the cocoon of silk worm in the <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we would take a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different environments, and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the <unk> structure are being transmitted directly by the environment.
They often get rid of silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we could shape raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we went through this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot making <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms happen to more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat to the heat of the light and the heat worms over the structure.
We were ready for <unk>
We asked <unk> silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready for us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they put eggs, put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
And the biological silk is about the <unk> <unk> <unk> they give all of this pavilion with the integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms <unk> <unk> kilometers.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route as well.
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the latest frontier of design is to give us life to the products and the buildings that surround us to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions in the world.
What it takes us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of design, which brings us from a design inspired by a nature inspired by the design, which requires us for the first time, that we take us in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked this?
You can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and he took websites on the web. I was playing the guitar on an punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And usually I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to go on.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something completely different, and I'm going to get it out of it, and I have found <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to take it on.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn this stuff into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my own passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad in me is not <unk> at all.
I was worried to be afraid of commitment, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something I would like to have raised back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
Let me tell you where they were doing it, they learned from culture.
You ask first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what we were going to do?"
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or I want to be <unk>
We had the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is going over and over again as we grow various ways, <unk> <unk> students are asking them to choose the university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, not inspired by dreaming of all they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the contrary, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults are <unk> maybe they are <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they will have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to have something to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative lives.
It's a breath for this.
Could it be able to help it <unk> in three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we have to do the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
For the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who I was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
They have any term you like it or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three <unk>
One: synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests in our visualization of data, and travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens in the intersections.
It comes out of the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is very quick.
When we <unk> we <unk> we go to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because of it being a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> for full time and writer <unk>
As a little girl, <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they started their relationship, and this ability helps to write compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is <unk> a waste of time to have a loss of time to do what you would tell you, even if you end it up.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of other videos, other websites, sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> Magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes as rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas and quickly learning and <unk> three abilities where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're a <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in your heart <unk>
<unk> the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you.
In fact, some of the best teams come up with a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into deep and put ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to be able to do how we're connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them will be told to simply be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said that, if there's one thing that you will take away from this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with your inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you're a heart, then <unk> for all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world are <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we had a woman named <unk> they led to a psychiatric disease.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately, passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more surprising thing.
If you had to have been living today, we couldn't give it to her more help than the <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that now we call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for HIV, for <unk> and much more.
But a little moved on the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the ability to Alzheimer's Alzheimer's will be almost one of two of two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their years with Alzheimer's Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or loved with Alzheimer's.
Just in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs rise to an increase in by 2050, by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's percent actually costs us more Alzheimer's and cause a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but all the world's <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last couple of years, all of the last few years, all of us -- the scientists, Alzheimer's Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable side.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the heart of Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical harm caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and cognitive skills, the damage to the fuel is caused by Alzheimer's reduces life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they are made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other and forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and identifying what step back to block is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we can do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of the wires have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that <unk> specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see it moves with normal.
These maggots, on the other hand, have a protein molecules that hit each other within them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs in a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive engine -- but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and fix.
After <unk> years, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, of overcoming the Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we call it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to move forward in HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
We had this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
In love with somebody, I do this.
The article is a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience to the test myself was a night last night.
So the approach is quite simple: Two strangers are going to be done to get 36 more and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number three: When was the last time you get to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> I really want to tell you about your partner what you like about him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really really struck me about it, the point that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I was able to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
But we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I would send it to the Catholic column -- this is a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask, they still follow these together.
And the reason I think that you challenge this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was actually very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been invited to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousands of these.
And that came up a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as a result, I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and then on Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And Sunday already had been called, Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received more than eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing with clues about <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that life love of one has been international news --  -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or write it, what they did every day for weeks, they were doing the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And many messages appear immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers -- like this.
I was interviewed my radio and <unk>
Even, I took a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where your <unk> is?
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship on an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't ready for the breadth of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for St. <unk> which included the experience of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public onset together.
I would have a television interviews, and I <unk> the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid I was afraid of becoming the <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if it really <unk> if it was able to produce <unk> <unk> not just an adventure, but love real, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer me.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you put together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of doing these 36 <unk> questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in the same study in 1997. And the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking at interpersonal approach, between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were closer after doing it. Several more studies, they also used protocol protocol as well as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they've used it between people of <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk to a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and it didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you're going to tell you about the person who was doing it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and went through a really hard <unk>
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to pretty much my adult life, and he was my first real love, and he had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I took to the science.
And I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be a certain form of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just read for the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I met the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat down then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in a way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand than I am.
But I can also see me more clearly and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably allowed me to demand me.
What I'm looking for for love is a <unk> not only to be <unk> today, and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know whether they were still together.
The story that the media said about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk of risk, and this is a very controversial story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that says, still still together?
And his content with an answer of Yes/No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we do more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things were <unk> and how to know when to cut and get it out.
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to one relationship? Or even more, how you live with <unk>
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we will get rid of each other, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> fallen because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading now, not because in the moment, it had not considered everything that was supposed to do.
I didn't consider how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was always going to choose or not.
So I want you to be enough to have done and say, 36 questions, have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and fun and expressed that choice on the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think really.
And what I'm going to do, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by <unk> <unk> and in a certain way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York does a while.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
And I took a box of wood, and they <unk> a dollar bill -- a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our kind <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At one point I was in <unk> <unk> like I like to go to tour and make <unk> and all of those things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I took it all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> in the Agnes Martin, the covered with resin and a bee kept <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking it could be <unk>
Instead, it happened to be the opposite: in some way it seemed to increase as size, as if it was to be able to get the text with a <unk>
So I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was finding out the street, all that I could find out of the street, all that I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out, and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> to draw just like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I took out of the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can do an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was cool, man.
At some point I became interested in human form, sculptures of resin of natural size with human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I would get off.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use it.
So I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing on a window, then on another window and another window, and he had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five feet long.
It's twice as expensive, so it's 10 meters composition.
It's a bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals with animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
So here is where the creatures with animals with animals are headed for <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a <unk> god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that can be found if they look very well in the ocean.
But anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand gets clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird peak and spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, the tail goes on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in an eye of <unk> terrorist cards.
They have <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from the terrorists.
It's very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material is <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they are together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting a few years old.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1,300 pounds of a <unk> of the <unk>
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's my chest -- you can <unk> the ticket.
I'm going to accompany you over the rest of the body, and there's a waterfall coming out of your chest, and that covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has -- a kind of thing that goes on.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue,
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you be <unk>
But anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like those boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a <unk> a musician, a musician, a <unk> a museum -- a museum -- an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
We have the box and all of the people in each other, with each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When one <unk> who is and the box in which it's living on.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of the countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> for any drug <unk> effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take <unk> drugs are going to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known for their side effects of <unk> in most negative effects, because in the time that it takes to your blood current -- and even worse for the time that it takes to your fate, which is where it's more important, that is where it's more important.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes. The lungs, the lungs, where the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the stream of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells <unk>
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life run by <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "You know, to make the treatment directly the treatment of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> to care and wounds of diabetes, they can be used for anything else -- including the transport transport of drugs.
In fact, we are already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small, <unk> holes that open and shut up almost to the infected cells with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people say, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit powerful <unk> laser beam on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before they even realized, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or in plates of <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, it's our laser -- we're going to make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it's heading to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you're successful, this technology can lead to the total of HIV from the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researchers in the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups -- <unk> organizations like terrorists, <unk> or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence from violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to the confrontation not violent.
I do a field work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving almost everything in the course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace agreements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they think about how they do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't get <unk>
The armed struggle and political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
Today's armed groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the decade of 1980, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Likewise, the Palestinian Palestinian met by his suicide attacks against Israel also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking again.
<unk> a complex tool of communication radio stations TV radio channels, websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed magazine printed magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit them to better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else, create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, put in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state of the state and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by war, or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can be understood as they also looked at the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, safety has a high free price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling out a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and lets these groups strengthen and increase their power.
For example, electoral electoral in 2006 from Palestinian Hamas can't be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill in <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, involved in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated organizations are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, running all of their <unk> collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak things are states, like in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap the actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in their tools.
It takes that vacuum of government to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand the better groups -- we will understand better what incentives offer to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors not <unk> the military power can win some <unk> but we won't give us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals -- we need long-term investments to fill that safety vacuum to fill that vacuum vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My views on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> tag that would be unfair to the <unk>
I'm a <unk> but quite bad.
And so I got a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then on interviews, people started calling the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women, <unk> women with men and <unk> sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that could be a feminist.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo word.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They were the same paycheck for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have right to use in a right way and affordable the contraceptives and services in the <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to figure out our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and much more.
We need to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I listen to rap music <unk>
Even though the letter degrades the women and the <unk> the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is amazing.
Do you really have your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical expression.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects, the collection of garbage and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> fairy fairy <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his election, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I hate that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in a way that makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women -- gay workers, gay and <unk> for white, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist feminist background.
It also happens to the following: I feel a lot of <unk>
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it would happen to perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think of <unk> of that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> fear of what that tag means for fear of not being able to fulfill the unusual expectations of it.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music Magazine 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star -- feminism and <unk> women and the young men who become feminist is something to be proud of it.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics actually started arguments if <unk> was or not true.
It takes their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
We are looking at the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We're going to be much more there of sane and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> feminism percent of any woman, <unk> until there's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a most inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give it to the action and be a little more <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change effectively affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music that will be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions can justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three-year-old <unk>
It's two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also so brave. I want to grow in a world.
They are going to be inspired by the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be done as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as sports, and <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio block when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies don't treat women more than such as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes are dealing with their partners as <unk>
In any case, the white men -- especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his project, to participate in his project, or work with you, until he doesn't include a number of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they were going to engage in this kind of projects, we can also empower it to be included until more as we are being able to overcome the barriers to the security points.
So we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can commit these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in the power directors and government producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting change and significant.
We can also be able to be able to claim our feminism, well, bad, or from any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist to not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, especially because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
And a few boys were <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't get rid of that I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And so I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like me, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have your brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, too, I found that if I was a little brave person, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the subjective reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little brave when you need to be a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because I was exposed to <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that <unk> that can be lousy for a child with an immune system -- is one of the most easily infectious diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that broke the argument on autism and the <unk> vaccines itself, and marked by being an mortgage fraud by the British Medical Medical
It doesn't believe the most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of fathers around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the growth of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it, create all your professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates are continued to be just about three or four children for <unk>
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started to <unk>
Six fundraising firms like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic, as if I could get rid of another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of his son, the visual contact.
If the pollen criteria had to figure out why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors tell the story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corner of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a children's psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- he published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be <unk> worlds and private, <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could make fun for hours waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey in the panic by <unk> like when he didn't put his favorite toy in your favorite place without knowing it.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the years of 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, I stated that I had seen less than 150,000 true cases of their syndrome as far as South Africa, from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, I will give that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had been <unk> that he had turned to nine of 10 children to her office to be autistic to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of a child <unk> caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, have been kept in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could tell between 18 <unk> before the age of two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite record, he says, <unk> <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills saying things like kids were simply <unk> what they heard their parents who were desperate to win their approval <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mother <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child to a child with no training services, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To advocate for the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic kids and their families, and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They did a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
We had a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic kids in the community.
What they saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was a lot more <unk> and diverse <unk>
Some children couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, or dinosaurs or <unk>
In other ways, these children didn't fit in nice <unk> and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of your data.
How did no one didn't realize these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he was able to see buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> at their own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was talking German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document provides a alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in the clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability <unk> in life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> space during the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, <unk> called them their little teachers, and he started to help the development of education in education that were especially right for them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum on <unk> known in pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> so the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked on silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> -- <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a wider and <unk>
These changes didn't fall into broken it.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> acting as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and fathers around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I had no longer to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it was, how people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the <unk> a simple, powerful story -- and <unk> credible history as bad as autism theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, poor people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that these are puzzles to solve by the new medical advances -- the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean that it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> -- and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
Indeed, people autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> that believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in understanding of teachers, employers who are willing to support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As opposed to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
